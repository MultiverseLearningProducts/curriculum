# Next Steps

Having completed the previous assignments, it is now time to put it all together and create a document which sets out the plan for your MVP. Remember, you're only tasked with creating the frontend for your given business oppurtunity.

## Assignment

In your groups, decide which user stories and requirements will form the basis of your MVP. 

Remember that:

> "the minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort."
<small>Eric Ries</small>

Create a document which includes all your work from the previous exercises and clearly defines your MVP. 

Share this document with your coach at the end of the lesson.

## Asynchronous work

The next module will involve creating wireframes of your MVP UI. As such, your task to complete *before the next workshop* is to learn a prototyping tool and create a wireframe mockup of one of your favourite website's pages. For example, you could learn Figma and use it to create a wireframe your Netflix homepage. You will need to bring this mockup to the next session to share with the class.

Suggested wireframing tools:
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
* [MockFlow](https://www.mockflow.com/)
* [Moqups](https://moqups.com/)
