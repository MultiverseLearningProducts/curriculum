## Lesson
We have a new requirement for our restaurant application. Customers must be able to rate their visit to a restaurant. 

A Rating will consist of a 'number of stars'.

![restaurant reviews example comments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/114306968-909f4280-9ad5-11eb-920a-08cca02dafe5.png)

This means we need to extend our data model to include a `Rating` class/table which is associated to the `Restaurant` table as follows:
```js
Restaurant.hasMany(Rating, {as: 'ratings', foreignKey: 'restaurant_id'})
Rating.belongsTo(Restaurant, {foreignKey: 'restaurant_id'})
```

To display the overall rating you will need to `findAll` the ratings associated to a restaurant and then calculate the average, displaying this as a star (or other) icon on the screen.

## Assignment
1. Add a ratings system for the restaurant model. Get ideas for styling from sites like [Trip Advisor](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/) or [Trust Pilot](https://uk.trustpilot.com/).

1. Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review

### Assignment extension tasks
Extend the rating functionality by allowing review comments to be added alongside the star rating. Make sure you add server-side validation to ensure malicious content cannot be added into the review comments.
