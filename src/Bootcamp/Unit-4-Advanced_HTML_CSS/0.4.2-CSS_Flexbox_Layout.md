### The bad old days

Layout methods and CSS have come a long way. Before Flexbox and Grid (see the chapter on this), developers used things like HTML frames, tables and CSS float to create layouts. All of these had their limitations: frames required multiple HTML files to be loaded into each frame, tables were never meant for layouts and produced lots of code bloat and last but not least, float introduced a quirk where the floated elements' parent container would collapse, ending up with a height of zero. The _clearfix_ hack was then deployed to get around this issue.

These days we have Flexbox and CSS Grid to make layouts more consistent and predictable.

> Whole design systems like Bootstrap were built around the idea of float and clearfix (Bootstrap now uses Flexbox)

### When to use flexbox

Any scenario where you have multiple columns or elements that need to be side by side are good candidates for flexbox.

Check out the mock up below. We could use flexbox to handle the two columns in the main design as well as three articles that need to be on the same row (more on this in the assignment).

### How to use flexbox

To get up and running with flex, we need to establish a _flex container_ element with some child div elements. We then add `display: flex` to the parent.

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  background-color: pink;
}
```

Checkout [this](https://jsfiddle.net/m2s7rktc/3/) link for an example and use it to try the examples below.

#### Flex direction

By default the boxes are arranged in a row, but this can be changed with one line:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  background-color: pink;
  flex-direction: column; /* add this line */
}
```

To get back to the row arrangement, just remove the flex-direction attribute or add `flex-direction: row`.

> Flex direction comes in handy when working with responsive layouts

#### Justifying the content

This is where Flexbox _really_ starts to shine. By default the boxes are justified to the left using `justify-content: flex-start`. We can change that by adding:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  background-color: pink;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: flex-end; /* add this line */
}
```

Want to center the boxes? This is how:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  background-color: pink;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: center; /* add this line */
}
```

Want to evenly space the boxes out? No problem:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  background-color: pink;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: space-between; /* add this line */
}
```

#### Aligning the content

Along with justifying the content center, left, right, etc, you can align the items on the vertical plane. We do this with `align-items`:

```css
.flex-container {
  /* other css attributes */

  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

Notice here that we've achieved true centering on the horizontal and vertical planes in just two lines. To do this in plain old CSS without Flexbox in the past meant using position absolute with a negative margin hack.

Conveniently, many of the align-item properties are shared with justify-content, including: flex-start, flex-end, center and space-between.

Check out the W3C's guide [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp), then add some more boxes and play around with the various settings to get a feel for align-items.

#### Flex wrap

Flex supports the ability to _wrap_ elements as viewport/device width gets smaller and is therefore useful for responsive layouts.

See [this](https://jsfiddle.net/u1jqogb2/29/) link for an example. Be sure to add/remove the property and reduce the screensize to see the effect. Notice that with just one line, the boxes collapse nicely into one column, then expand as more space becomes available.

#### The Flex property (flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis)

## Assignment

Take a look at [this](https://jsfiddle.net/q61tL5pb/1/) simple web page. All of the ingredients are in place for you to add some flex styles and some comments have been added to signpost you.

Your task is to add the required flex styles to make the page look like the mock up seen earlier.
