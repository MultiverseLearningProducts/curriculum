# Logical Data Model

## Pre-requisites
* Try out [https://planttext.com](https://planttext.com) for drawing UML diagrams
* Install the `PlantUML` plugin for VSCode

## Learning Objectives
* Create a logical data model using a UML class diagram
* Use 'has many' and 'belongs to' to correctly label relationship between classes

## Lesson
Imagine we are going to build a Restaurant application like Deliveroo or Uber Eats. We firstly start by designing our logical data model. An application logical data model is like the foundations of a building. Everything is build on top of this foundation.

In a Restaurant system what are some of the objects you would expect to find?

1. Restaurant
1. Menu
1. Item (a dish with a price)

What are the relationships between these? 

A Restaurant can have many Menus, for example:

* a drinks menu
* a mains menu
* a dessert menu

A Menu belongs to a Restaurant. A Menu has many Items. An Item belongs to a Menu. Can you figure out all of that? It gets confusing and quite complicated to imagine if someone is just verbally explaining it to us. We need a way to visually represent it so we can clearly communicate our design.

### UML
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardised way to represent abstract structures in programming.

A logical data model can be represented using an [Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)](https://plantuml.com/ie-diagram) which is an extension to the UML Class notation. Associations and 'has many' relationships can be modelled using the appropriate syntax.

Example of Airports in UML

## Assignment
Design a logical data model for the following classes. Include the relationships between them.

1. Restaurant
1. Menu
1. Item

Commit your UML diagram into Github and share the link with your coach for review.
