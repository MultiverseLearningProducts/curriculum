        <h1>Overview of Standards and Assessments</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Software Engineering Programme (SWE)! We are excited you are joining Multiverse to start your apprentice journey. Before you start, we want to give you a little more information on how you will be assessed and what the learning will look like. This programme is composed of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5 week bootcamp</strong> prepares you to enter the workplace ready for your first challenges. We cover the basics of the software development life cycle and begin to understand the role of a software developer. As well as learning the basics of programming in HTML and Javascript, you will take on coding challenges and gain practical experience of the entire software stack.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/curriculum/Bootcamp/index.html">Bootcamp</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Module 1:</strong> A 2 week bootcamp that builds and expands on the RESTful concept introduced in the 5-week bootcamp. Topics covered include: HTTP/HTTPS, RESTful API best practices, Building out a RESTful API, Securing an API using Basic Auth, Sessions, and Securing an API with OAuth</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Module 2:</strong> A two week bootcamp that will get you develop your proficiency with HTML, CSS and asynchronous JavaScript. You'll cover: WebSockets; web workers; XMLHTTPRequests; canvas elements; media elements; responsive design through media queries; and error handling in Javascript. By the end of the module you will be prepared to take the Microsoft Technology Associate Certification (MTA): Introduction to Programming Using JavaScript</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Module 3:</strong> A two week bootcamp to fully understand and navigate the software development lifecycle.  Through a mixture of independent reading and a team project, you will learn about both agile and waterfall development methodologies and experience 2 x 1-week sprints. By the end of the module you will be prepared to take the BCS Level 4 Diploma in Software Development Methodologies</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Module 4:</strong> A two week bootcamp to get you to EPA-readiness for the 5-day synoptic project that forms part of the Apprenticeship EPA. Through completing two individual projects, you will be prepared for the demands of the EPA synoptic project.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How will you be assessed?</h2>
<p>During your sessions with your coach you will work on a variety of assignments. Below is a list of some of the ways you may be assessed in the programme.</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects to be completed after the day of learning</li>
<li>Short answer questions around understanding of software engineering concepts</li>
<li>Scenario based questions around role as a developer</li>
<li>Questions evaluating your role in the business with your learning</li>
<li>Individual projects you will complete throughout a module</li>
<li>Group projects you will complete throughout a module</li>
</ul>
<h2>Standards of Software Engineering</h2>
<p>All the lessons you will go through during the Software Engineering Programme are directly aligned with the level 4 Software Developer programme as designed by the Institute for Apprenticeships &amp; Technical Education.  Use this page as a reference to reflect on what you are learning and areas to develop while on the job. The standards are:</p>
<h3>Technical Competencies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Logic: writes good quality code (logic) with sound syntax in at least one language</li>
<li>User interface: can develop effective user interfaces for at least one channel</li>
<li>Data: can effectively link code to the database/data sets</li>
<li>Test: can test code and analyse results to correct errors found using either V-model manual testing and/or using unit testing</li>
<li>Problem solving: can apply structured techniques to problem solving, can debug code and can understand the structure of programmes in order to identify and resolve issues</li>
<li>Design: can create simple data models and software designs to effectively communicate understanding of the program, following best practices and standards</li>
<li>Analysis: can understand and create basic analysis artefacts, such as user cases and/or user stories</li>
<li>Deployment : can understand and utilise skills to build, manage and deploy code into enterprise environments</li>
<li>Development lifecycle: can operate at all stages of the software development lifecycle, with increasing breadth and depth over time with initial focus on build and test.</li>
<li>Can apply good practice approaches according to the relevant paradigm (for example object oriented, event driven or procedural)</li>
<li>Can interpret and follow:
<ul>
<li>software designs and functional/technical specifications</li>
<li>company defined ‘coding standards’ or industry good practice for coding</li>
<li>testing frameworks and methodologies</li>
<li>company, team or client approaches to continuous integration, version and source control</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can respond to the business environment and business issues related to software development</li>
<li>Can operate effectively in their own business’s, their customers’ and the industry’s environments</li>
<li>Can apply the maths required to be a software developer (e.g. algorithms, logic and data structures)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical Knowledge and Understanding</h3>
<ul>
<li>Understands and operates at all stages of the software development lifecycle</li>
<li>Understands the similarities and differences (taking into account positives and negatives of both approaches) between agile and waterfall software development methodologies</li>
<li>Understands how teams work effectively to produce software and contributes appropriately</li>
<li>Understands and applies software design approaches and patterns and can interpret and implement a given design, compliant with security and maintainability requirements</li>
<li>Understands and responds to the business environment and business issues related to software development</li>
<li>Understands and applies the maths required to be a software developer (eg algorithms, logic and data structures)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Underpinning Skills, Attitudes and Behaviours</h3>
<ul>
<li>Logical and creative thinking skills</li>
<li>Analytical and problem solving skills</li>
<li>Ability to work independently and to take responsibility</li>
<li>Can use own initiative</li>
<li>A thorough and organised approach</li>
