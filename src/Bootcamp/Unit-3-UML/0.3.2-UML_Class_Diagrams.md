# UML Class Diagrams

## Pre-requisites
* Try out [https://planttext.com](https://planttext.com) for drawing UML diagrams
* Install the `PlantUML` plugin for VSCode

## Learning Objectives
* Create a UML class diagram
* Understand how to correctly label relationships between classes such as 
* Use 'has many' and 'belongs to' to correctly label relationship between classes

## Lesson
Imagine we are going to build a Restaurant application like Deliveroo or Uber Eats. We firstly start by designing our data model. An application data model is like the foundations of a building. Everything is build on top of this foundation.

In a Restaurant system what are some of the objects you would expect to find?

1. Restaurant
1. Menu
1. Item (a dish with a price)

What are the relationships between these? 

A Restaurant can have many Menus, for example:

* a drinks menu
* a mains menu
* a dessert menu

A Menu belongs to a Restaurant. A Menu has many Items. An Item belongs to a Menu. Can you figure out all of that? It gets confusing and quite complicated to imagine if someone is just verbally explaining it to us. We need a way to visually represent it so we can clearly communicate our design.

### UML

Unified Modeling Language is a standardised way to represent abstract structures in programming, like a data model.

## Assignment
Design a data model for the following classes. Include the relationship between them.

1. Restaurant
1. Menu
1. Item

Commit your UML diagram into Github and share the link with your coach for review.
