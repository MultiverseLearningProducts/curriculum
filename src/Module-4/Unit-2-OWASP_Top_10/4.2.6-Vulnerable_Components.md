# Vulnerable Components

## Learning Objectives

* Understand what vulnerable components are
* Understand how to avoid using vulnerable components

## Vulnerable Components

Modern software development is more and more becoming about glueing programmes together using 3rd-party libaries and tools. However, an application which relies on a vulnerable library may itself be vulnerable as a consequence.

## Avoiding Vulnerable Components

* Remove unnecessary libaries and components from your codebase/platform
* Regularly scan your dependencies (using a tool like Snyk) to check for anything vulnerabilities that need addressing
* Keep software (operating systems, runtimes, libaries etc.) up-to-date with the latest patches

## Assignment

There are many tools which exist to help you identify vulnerable components within your application. A popular one is Snyk.

Follow the instructions on [their website](https://snyk.io/test/) to test a local Node project.

If you get an error like "running scripts is disabled on this system" you may need to preface the commands with `npx` like

```npx snyk auth```

Snyk will output a report on your project as a webpage.
