# What is middleware?

## Learning Objectives
* Describe the middleware design pattern
* Use what you have learnt in previous lessons to secure an API using Basic Auth

### Lesson
Your API should support a `User' resource. A user will need at least a name, email and password:

|HTTP Method|URL|Status code|Description|
|-----------|---|-----------|-----------|
|GET|`/users`|200|retrieve all users|
|POST|`/users`|201|create a new user|
|GET|`/users/{id}`|200|retrieve a specific user|
|PUT|`/users/{id}`|200|update a user|
|DELETE|`/users/{id}`|200|delete a user|

Our User resource in an unsecured state is just like any other resource like airports, training shoes or albums. However we are going to treat it differently.

To protect resources we need to authenticate the user making the request. We are using basic auth to do that by putting the _username:password_ in the headers of the request.

Our server now needs to check the request is authentic and from a user it knows before responding. That check needs to happen before we respond.

![middleware diagram](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*Fnreje0WgqdBjjLXop9L0A.png)

As that check happens in the middle of the request response cycle, it has been given the name of middleware. This is a generic design pattern you will see in many systems.

A whole series of things can happen in middleware not just authentication, but also authorisation. Thats why the diagram above has 2 middleware rings. There are 2 middlewares the request has to pass through before it gets to the controller. Below is a general pattern for a middleware function.

```javascript
function (request, response, next) {
  // check or change something in the request
  // maybe its not ok so from here you might
  return response.code(403) // status code 403 forbidden
  // the controller was never reached!
  // maybe all is well and you can contiune with the request
  // calling next() finishes this middleware and goes onto
  // either the next middleware or into the controller/route handler itself
  return next()
}
```

❓ What other things might you want to do in middleware?

❓ is the password sent on every request or cached?

We are going to implement middlewares on our server. First of you need to authenticate the request and only accept requests from users your server knows about (the users in your database). We don't want any user to be able to see a list of all the other users, that is our authorisation rule.

### Assignment
  * Create an API which allows Create, Read, Update and Delete of a User using either SpringBoot or Node.js
  * Add sessions so authenticated users continue to have access to the `/users/:id` end point.
  * Enhance your API to check the incoming username and password against the details held in the database you created in the previous lesson
  * (Optional) Create a simple form which sends a username and password to your API using Basic Auth (i.e. simulates what Postman was doing in the previous lesson).

Protect your Create, Read, Update and Delete user resources with Basic Authentication using the following code:

|Javascript|Java|
```javascript
// check for a basic auth header with correct credentials
app.use(basicAuth({
  authorizer: dbAuthorizer, // customer authorizer,
  authorizeAsync: true, // we check the db which makes this async
  challenge: true,
  unauthorizedResponse: (req) => {
    return `unauthorized. ip: ${req.ip}`
  }
}));

// our custom async authorizer middleware, this is called for each request
function dbAuthorizer(username, password, callback) {
  const sql = "select password from users where username = ?;";
  db.get(sql, [username], async (err, user) => {
    err ? callback(err) : bcrypt.compare(password, user.password, callback);
  });
```
```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private DataSource dataSource;

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {
        // do not use the line below in production apps!!
        httpSecurity.csrf().disable(); // hack to support DELETE method
        httpSecurity.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and().httpBasic();
    }

    @Autowired
    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder authentication)
            throws Exception {
        // use jdbc authentication (for in memory authentication use authentication.inMemoryAuthentication())
        authentication.jdbcAuthentication()
                .dataSource(dataSource)
                .authoritiesByUsernameQuery("select username,authority "
                        + "from authorities "
                        + "where username = ?")
                .usersByUsernameQuery(
                        "select username, password, 'true' as enabled from users where username = ?");

    }

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        // specify we want the password hashed using bcrypt
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
```
