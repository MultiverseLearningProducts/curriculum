# Object Relational Mapping - part 2

## Learning Objectives
* Implement an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) design pattern with relationships between classes

## Pre-requisites
Object Relational Mapping - part 1

## Lesson
There is an important dimension missing from our 'home grown' ORM implementation - relationships. As we see from the class diagram below, our Restaurants have Menus and our Menus have Menu Items. 
![UML Class Diagram showing relationships between Restaurant, Menu and MenuItem classes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/105141638-5d11d500-5af1-11eb-98ee-d177df9c5894.png)

We want to be able to access our Menus like this:

```javascript
restaurant.menus // [Menu, Menu]
```
and from each Menu we want to be able to access the list of items on the Menu:
```javascript
menu.items // [Item, Item]
```
We therefore need to expand our Restaurant class to include a function that will create and add a Menu instance to the Restaurant. 

```javascript
async addMenu(title) {
    const menu = await new Menu({title, restaurant_id: this.id})
    this.menus.push(menu)
}
```
Then we have the work to go get the items for a menu, and the menus for a restaurant. So when I instantiate a Restaurant with a row from the database (the restaurant is stored with an id), I will also need to go get all the menus. That way a new instance of a restaurant has all it's menus in place, and each of those menus have their items in place. I expect to be able to drill down through all my connected data like this:
```javascript
restaurant.menus[0].items[0].price // 12.50
```

## Assignment

* Enhance your solution from xxx to include the relationships between your Restaurant and Menu classes and the Menu and Menu Item classes as described above.
* Ensure you have unit tests that cover the new functionality.
* Commit your code and a screen shot of your coverage report to GitHub and let you coach know it is ready for review.
