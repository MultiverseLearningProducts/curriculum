# Introduction

This module focuses on building out your frontend design in your framework of choice. We will be using React for the code-along portion of this unit. You don't have to use React and our recommendation is to use whichever framework you and your Agile team are most comfortable with. Many of the concepts like state management, two-way data binding and the Virtual DOM will still be applicable.

If this is your first time using a framework, use React with us and learn how quickly and fun it can be to set-up a frontend in a framework!

## Alternative courses

We've made every effort to make the session notes as easy to follow as we can but we understand everyone learns in different ways. If you're a visual learner and would prefer to learn via video, or if you'd like to supplement your work with your coach with a tried and tested resource, we would highly recommend the free courses over at [ReactJS.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
