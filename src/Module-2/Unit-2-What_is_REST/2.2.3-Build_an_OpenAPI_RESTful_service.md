# Build your own openAPI RESTful service

## Learning Objectives
* Produce an API server with integrated documentation
* Implement CRUD operations on a single resource using RESTful endpoints

## Pre-requisites
* You will need a valid `airports-config.yaml` openAPI definition file see [2.2.2](https://multiverselearningproducts.github.io/curriculum/Module-2/Unit-2-What_is_REST/2.2.2-The_OpenAPI_spec.html).

## Lesson
Auto generated code is all very well, but you also need to know how to build your own RESTful service. In this session we are going to build our service from the ground up and practice defining RESTful routes for ourselves. You will be integrating OpenAPI documentation using swagger. There are a few steps below to get you started. If you would like to build your server in another language like PHP or C# you are very welcome to do so. You might need to look online for instructions to perform the following steps for the framework you are using. i.e. for PHP you can use [Symfony](https://symfony.com/).

### Dependencies

First of all find and install the dependencies your server is going to need to create auto generated documentation.

|Javascript|Java|
```javascript
{
  "name": "airports",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Use this package.json to start your assignment",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "author": "your Github username can go here",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "swagger-jsdoc": "^6.0.1",
    "swagger-ui-express": "^4.1.6",
    "js-yaml": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```
```java
/*
  Goto https://start.spring.io and generate a project with the group 'org.whitehat' and package name 'org.whitehat.airports' that includes 'Spring Boot Web' as a dependency. Once you have downloaded and unzipped your project, add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml` file (in the `<dependencies>` list).  
*/
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
			<artifactId>springdoc-openapi-ui</artifactId>
			<version>1.5.2</version>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.googlecode.json-simple</groupId>
			<artifactId>json-simple</artifactId>
			<version>1.1.1</version>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
			<artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
			<version>2.11.1</version>
		</dependency>
```

### Configuration

The next step is to configure your server to create API documentation from your code. Previously we used the OpenAPI yaml file to describe our routes, but that method means we would have to keep updating the config yaml file if we made changes to the endpoint. Instead now we are going to use swagger to generate docs NOT from a yaml file - but from the actual code itself. You can remove the `paths` property from your yaml file.

|Javascript|Java|
```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express')
const airports = require('./airports.json')
const YAML = require('js-yaml')
const fs = require('fs')
const docs = YAML.load(fs.readFileSync('./airports-config.yaml').toString())
const swaggerDocs = require('swagger-jsdoc')({
    swaggerDefinition: docs,
    apis: ['./server.js']
})

app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocs, {explorer: true}))

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Airport API ready. Documents at http://localhost:3000/api-docs"))
```
```java
// in a file named AirportsApplication.java
package org.whitehat.airports;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

import io.swagger.v3.oas.models.OpenAPI;
import io.swagger.v3.oas.models.info.Info;
import io.swagger.v3.oas.models.servers.Server;

@SpringBootApplication
public class AirportsApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(AirportsApplication.class, args);
	}

	@Bean
	public OpenAPI customOpenAPI(@Value("${springdoc.version}") String appVersion) {

		return new OpenAPI()
			.info(new Info()
				.title("Airports")
				.version(appVersion)
				.description("28,000 airports")
			)
			.addServersItem(new Server().url("http://localhost:8080/"))
			.addServersItem(new Server().url("https://api.whitehatcoaches.org.uk/"));
	}
}


/****** ADDITIONAL CONFIG ******
in /src/main/resources/application.properties
  springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/api-docs
  springdoc.version=1.0.0
*/

// Access the API at `http://localhost:8080/api-docs`
```

### Auto Document Paths

Now we can start to annotate our routes to support Swagger auto documenting our paths. Note that Swagger will read the Spring annotations to determine paths.

|Javascript|Java|
```javascript
// server.js
/**
 * @swagger
 * /airports:
 *   get:
 *     summary: returns an array of airports
 *     responses:
 *       200:
 *         description: all the airports
 *         content:
 *           application/json:
 *             schema:
 *               type: array
 *               items:
 *                 properties:
 *                   icao:
 *                     type: string
 *                   iata:
 *                     type: string
 *                   name:
 *                     type: string
 *                   city:
 *                     type: string
 *                   state:
 *                     type: string
 *                   country:
 *                     type: string
 *                   elevation:
 *                     type: integer
 *                   lat:
 *                     type: float
 *                   lon:
 *                     type: float
 *                   tz:
 *                     type: string
 *                 example:
 *                   icao: "00AK"
 *                   iata: ""
 *                   name: "Lowell Field"
 *                   city: "Anchor Point"
 *                   state: "Alaska"
 *                   country: "US"
 *                   elevation: 450
 *                   lat: 59.94919968
 *                   lon: -151.695999146
 *                   tz: "America/Anchorage"                 
 */
app.get('/airports', (req, res) => {
    res.send(airports)
})
```
```java
package org.whitehat.airports;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.util.List;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.type.TypeReference;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/airports")
public class AirportsController {
    private static List<Airport> airports;

    static {
        // next line is using the Try-With-Resource syntax to ensure that the
        // input stream gets closed (very important else get memory leaks!)
        try (InputStream is = AirportsController.class.getResourceAsStream("/static/airports.json");){
            ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

            airports = mapper.readValue(is, new TypeReference<List<Airport>>() {
            });
        } catch(IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

    }
    
    @GetMapping("/")
    public List<Airport> getAirports() {
        return AirportsController.airports;
    }

    // You can build out the rest of the endpoints
    // just a heads-up http://localhost:8080/airports/ remember the trailing slash.
    // Because Java is strongly typed swagger will to most of the work to document your endpoint - you can add extra information (go see the docs https://springdoc.org/)
}
```

in _javascript_ You can use schemas to save yourself repeating the definition of an `Airport`. If you create a class definition for an Airport you can annotate it then reference it in your route annotations. i.e. in an `Airport.js` file you can define your airport:

```javascript
/**
 * @swagger
 *   components:
 *     schemas:
 *       Airport:
 *         type: object
 *         properties:
 *           icao:
 *             type: string
 *           iata:
 *             type: string
 *           name:
 *             type: string
 *           city:
 *             type: string
 *           state:
 *             type: string
 *           country:
 *             type: string
 *           elevation:
 *             type: integer
 *           lat:
 *             type: float
 *           lon:
 *             type: float
 *           tz:
 *             type: string
 *         example:
 *           icao: "00AK"
 *           iata: ""
 *           name: "Lowell Field"
 *           city: "Anchor Point"
 *           state: "Alaska"
 *           country: "US"
 *           elevation: 450
 *           lat: 59.94919968
 *           lon: -151.695999146
 *           tz: "America/Anchorage"
 */

module.exports = class Airport {
    icao = ""
    iata = ""
    name = ""
    city = ""
    state = ""
    country = ""
    elevation = 0
    lat = 0.0
    lon = -0.0
    tz = ""

    constructor (data) {
        Object.assign(this, data)
    }
}
```

Then this can be referenced in your route definitions like this (you also have to reference the file in the `swagger-jsdoc` config):

```javascript
const swaggerDocs = require('swagger-jsdoc')({
    swaggerDefinition: docs,
    apis: ['./server.js', './Airport.js'] // <- reference the file your schema is in here
})
/**
 * @swagger
 * /airports:
 *   get:
 *     summary: returns an array of airports
 *     responses:
 *       200:
 *         description: all the airports
 *         content:
 *           application/json:
 *             schema:
 *               $ref: '#/components/schemas/Airport'                 
 */
app.get('/airports', (req, res) => {
    res.send(airports)
})
```

### Pagination

We have 28,000 airport records. Thats a lot. This would be much easier to consume in smaller chunks. Often large resources will be managed like this in "pages" of results. So lets say we have a page size of 25 that would mean we have to return only the first 25 airports (0 - 24 array indexes) that response would represent page 1. Page 2 would consist of the next 25 airports (25 - 49 array indexes). You will often see this handled as query parameters.

`http://localhost:3000/airports?page=2&pageSize=25`

❓ What pagination errors might you now need to handle?

❓ What different HTTP codes might an endpoint like this return?

## Assignment

Based on your `airports-config.yaml` OpenAPI definition file, can you build out a RESTful server with the same spec, only now the documented endpoints will be generated from the code itself. Implement pagination for the GET `/airports` route enabling users to define a page number (required) and an optional `pageSize` query parameter (this should default to 25).
