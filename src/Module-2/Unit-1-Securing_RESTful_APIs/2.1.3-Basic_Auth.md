# Authentication & Authorisation

## Learning Objectives
* Know the difference between authentication and authorisation
* Understand how usernames and passwords are encoded in the Basic Authentication HTTP scheme
* Implement a credential store of hashed passwords which can validate usernames and passwords sent via Basic Authentication

 > `Authentication` is the process of verifying who a user is. 

 > `Authorisation` is the process of verifying what they have access to. 

Here's an example to illustrate this: 

Imagine you have booked a hotel room. When you get to the checkout you are asked for you driving license to prove who you are - this is **authentication**.

Once authentication is complete, you are given a key card which gives you entry to your room - this is **authorisation** as you are being granted access to a resource (in this case your room). You are not authorised to access any other rooms.

In RESTful APIs, a failure to authenticate results in a 403 (Forbidden) HTTP status code. A failure to authorise results in a 401 (Unauthorized) HTTP status code.

### üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíªüë©üèæ‚Äçüíª Assignment
In breakout rooms, determine which of the following are examples of authentication and which are examples of authorisation:
   1. Showing your passport at the airport
   2. Determining which floor in a building an employee can access
   3. Checking a boarding pass before boarding a flight
   4. Giving an employee access to payroll information
   5. Entering a username and password to access Facebook
   6. Using biometrics (such as fingerprints) to unlock your laptop

## Basic Authentication

Now we have our API we need to consider how we will secure access to the API. For this we will use a username and password, commonly known as `Basic Authentication`. 

Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme that is built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends an HTTP request with an `Authorization` header that contains the word `Basic` followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password

Here is an example:
> Authorization: Basic ZnJlZC5mbGludHN0b25lQHdoaXRlaGF0Lm9yZy51azpteXBhc3N3MHJk

That long string of numbers and letters after the word "Basic" is a base64 encoded string. You can encode and decode base64 strings in your browser using a pair of functions called `atob` and `btoa`. Try it. In your console encode the following string "Hello you".

![an example of using b to a function and a to b function to encode and decode a string](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/104713069-451a0a00-571b-11eb-8f49-aeed427f2ce3.png)

### üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Assignment
From the string in the `Authorization` header above, determine the user's username and password.

‚ùì Do you think Basic Authentication is a secure scheme?

## Hashing passwords
### Learning Objectives
  * Understand why passwords should be hashed
  * Understand the implications of exposing sensitive data
  * Create a database of user names and hashed passwords 

Basic auth uses the `Authorization` header in the HTTP request, along with the "Basic" keyword and a base64 encoded string in the following format _username:password_. To validate that a user's login details are correct using Basic auth the server will look in the headers for this base64 encoded string and decode it. Now the server has the username and password sent from the client we need to match it with the username and password held in our database.

‚ùì Imagine if we held all our user's passwords in plaintext. What risks do you think this could cause?

**Answer** - we will have leaked sensitive information that your users have trusted you with. Imagine if they used the same username and password on other sites. Your organisation could face very large fines under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and suffer serious damage to its repretation - listen to this [video](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48905907) to hear about one recent example.

To avoid storing passwords in plaintext, we `hash` them with an one-way hashing function. You learnt about hashing last week. If the cryptographic function used for the hashing is strong, then it's computationally impossible to calculate the original password from the hash.

Bcrypt is a hashing algorithm which is [considered secure](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html) for password hashing. It enforces the use of a salt and has a work factor to recude the speed at which an attacker can crack the hash. Here are examples of how to use bcrypt in Javscript and Java:

|Javascript|Java|
```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt')
...
bcrypt.hash('password101', 10).then(console.log)
// $2b$10$AQXoVkfzAovJ9RHTtmd6N.Yegy3V9ALTlYDcCM76HxBqq044q6xLK
```
```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;

//...
BCryptPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
String hashedPassword = passwordEncoder.encode("your password");
// $2b$10$AQXoVkfzAovJ9RHTtmd6N.Yegy3V9ALTlYDcCM76HxBqq044q6xLK
```

You can then compare an incoming password against a hash as follows:

|Javascript|Java|
```javascript
bcrypt.compare('password101', '$2b$10$AQXoVkfzAovJ9RHTtmd6N.Yegy3V9ALTlYDcCM76HxBqq044q6xLK').then(console.log)
// true
```
```java
BCryptPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
boolean isMatch = passwordEncoder.matches("your password", "$2b$10$AQXoVkfzAovJ9RHTtmd6N.Yegy3V9ALTlYDcCM76HxBqq044q6xLK");
// true
```

### Assignment
Use the code above to generate hashes of some demo user passwords. Then add the usernames and their hashed passwords to a database.
