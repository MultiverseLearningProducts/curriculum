### What's wrong with Basic Auth?
  * The password is sent over the wire in Base64 encoding which can be easily decoded (if Basic Auth is used, it should always go over HTTPS for this reason)
  * The password is sent for each request meaning there is a large attack window 
  * Basic authentication does not have a logout function and the browser will store the credentials until it has been restarted

### Alternatives to Basic Authentication
To find out what alternatives there are to Basic Authentiation, please complete the "API Security 101" section of the [Getting Started with OAuth 2.0](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/oauth-2-getting-started/table-of-contents) course on Pluralsight (23 mins).
