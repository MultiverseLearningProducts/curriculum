# Adding the product details page

We're now in a position where we can code in the mechanism to handle the click through to a Product Details page.

## Learning Objectives

- Set-up links to the Product Details pages
- Test that each product's details page works

## Setting up routing

### Step 1

The first step is to create a component that React can render when a user clicks on a 'Full details' link. We'll call it `ProductDetails`. Here's the code to add inside `ProductDetails.js`:
```javascript
function ProductDetails (props) {
    const {
        name,
        description,
        images: [
            {
                title,
                imageSrc
            }
        ],
        price,
        addedToCart
    } = product
    return (
        <div class="product-details">
            <div class="product-details__main">
                <img src={imageSrc} alt={title} />
            </div>
            <aside>
            <h3>{name}</h3>
            <p>
                {description}
            </p>
            <p>
                &pound;{price}
            </p>
            <button onClick={() => props.addToCart(props.product)}>{addedToCart ? 'Remove from' : 'Add to'} cart</button>
            </aside>
      </div>
    )
}

export default ProductDetails
```
_NB_ _I'm using a different style of exporting here. When I import this I don't need to use the curly braces. It's not good to mix styles in your code. I just want you to know about the different ways you can export and import functions in ES6 javascript._

Import your component and create the route in __App__. Slot the following snippets into the right places in your __App.js__ file.
```js
import ProductDetails from './ProductDetails'

/* previously written code */

<Route path="/products/:productId">
    <ProductDetails addToCart={addToCart} data={data} />
</Route>
```
Notice how the route will be dynamic, we will be able to reference that __:productId__ route parameter from within the component. With that we can pick the product from the data that the user wants to learn more about. We are also going to pass in the __addToCart__ function so users can add the plant to their cart on this page as well.

## Create the dynamic Link

In the __Product__ component find the 'Full Details' anchor tag and refactor it to be a __Link__ component with a dynamic value.

```javascript
<Link to={`/products/${productId}`}>Full Details</Link>
```

## Grabbing the __:productId__

In your __ProductDetails__ component you can access the route param with __useParams__ which is a function from `react-router-dom` (NOT 'react'). Use it like this to extract the id.

```javascript
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom'

/* previously written code */

const { productId } = useParams()
```

## Assignment

- In your __ProductDetails__ component you now have the __productId__ that will match a __product.productId__ in the __props.data.products__ array. Can you complete the logic of your component so it displays the details for that plant on the full details page? 
- Style the page so it looks useable
- Test each 'Full details' link and try to track down and fix any errors that occur. Verify they're all working before proceeding on to the next lesson.
- Commit your work to Git! Regular commits to Git will ensure you can revert your code in the event of any issues.
