# HTML Forms

## Learning Objectives
* Understand the different attributes of HTML Forms
* Use simple Form validation to ensure valid input

## Pre-requisites
* Lesson [Route Parameters](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-APIs_and_Dynamic_Content/0.3.6_Route_Parameters.md)

## Lesson
To collect input from our user we need to use an [HTML Form](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_Forms.asp). 

Let's create a Form within a new page called `new.handlebars` and give it the following content:

```html
<h2>Add Restaurant</h2>

<form action="/restaurants" method="POST">
    <label>Name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" name="name"><br>

    <label>Image:</label><br>
    <input type="url" name="image"><br><br>

    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

This Form has 2 inputs, both of type `text`. The input type of `submit` creates a button which posts the Form data to the URL specified in the Form `action`. 

Let's create a new route to render the Form page:
```javascript
app.get('/new', async (req, res) => {
    res.render('new')
})
```

Before we create a new route to handle submission of data on this 'new' page, let's firstly think about the type of client-side validation we might want perForm. The slide deck below details some of the main types of Form validation.

Once Form validation is added, we need to create a new route on our server to receive and process the Form data. In our example Form above, we specify the Form data will be 'posted' to the `/restaurants` route hence our new route must match this URL path.

```javascript
app.post('/restaurants', async (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body); // this is the JSON body

    // TODO - add code to insert data into the database!

    res.redirect('/')
})
```

<strong>Important!</strong> In addition to the route, to read the Form data as if it were JSON from the request object we need to add the following config to express.

```javascript
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))
app.use(express.json())
```

## Assignment
* Add a new page with an HTML Form to support the creation of new restaurants
* Add validation to the Form, all input fields must:
     * be mandatory 
     * highlight to the user if input data is missing or incorrect
     * the image field must be a url
     * the name must only contain the letters a-z or space
* Add a link from the `home` page to this new page to allow users to add a new restaurant
* Add a route to retrieve the Form data and create the restaurant in the database
