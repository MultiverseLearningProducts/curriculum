# Static functions and properties

## Learning Objectives
* Differentiate `static` class properties from class `instance` properties
* Use `this.constructor` to access static properties
* Argue the case for static properties

## Lesson
In the [Objects in an Airport Domain](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-1-Object_Oriented_Programming/0.1.3-Objects_in_an_Airport_Domain) lesson we created objects from classes using the `new` keyword. For example, we constructed Passenger to board Planes and Bags to assign to Passengers. 

To complete our Airport system we want to be able to move our Planes (and the Passengers they transport) from one Airport to another. 

To do this, we need to be able to access one Airport from another Airport. We can't do this using the properties and functions of an instance of an Airport. For example, if we created London Heathrow (LHR) and Los Angles (LAX) Airports, how could we connect them?

`london.addAirport(LAX)` would be clumsy and hard to keep track of as each new Airport is created.

### Static properties
The `static` keyword defines a static function or property for a class. Static functions and static properties cannot be called on instances of the class, instead, they're called on the class itself. 

We need somewhere we can keep track of all the Airports that we create. Read the code snippet below. Can you see what we are doing?

```javascript
class Airport {
    static airports = []
    
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name
        this.planes = []
        this.constructor.airports.push(this)
    }
    
    land(plane) {
        this.planes.push(plane)
    }
}
```

`Airport.airports` holds an array of all the instances of `Airport` that have been created. Each time we construct an Airport we `push` it into the static array. Remember the `Airport` class is a blueprint for creating instances of airports. By adding static properties we are extending the functionality and state of the blueprint itself, not the instances of objects that are created from that blueprint. As well as adding properties to a class like this we could also define functions. For example `Airport.getAllNames()` might return an array of all the airport names `['LHR', 'LAX', 'DUB']`. The state and functions we'd want to store on the class itself is going to be state and functionality that will be applicable to all the instances of that class. Where as the state and functions of an instance of the class should just be applicable to that instance.

Your instances of the `Airport` class will be able to access properties of the `Airport`. In the code above we are accessing the array of airports in the constructor function with `this.constructor`.

## Assignment

* Think about and implement a way to "fly" a Plane object from one Airport to another.
* Write tested code that proves your planes can fly from one airport to another.
* Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review.

## Assignment extensions tasks
Consider when you would use `static` functions.
