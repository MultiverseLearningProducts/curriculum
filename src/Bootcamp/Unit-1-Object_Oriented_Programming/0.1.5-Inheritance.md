# Inheritance

## Learning Objectives
* Understand what inheritance is
* Understand the meaning of polymorphism
* Implement inheritance relationships in an airport domain

## Lesson
Inheritance is fundamental to an object oriented programming language. Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that inherit the properties and functions/methods of a parent class. We often think of the inheritance relationship as a _is a type of_ relationship, for example, car _is a type of_ vehicle, triangle _is a type of_ shape. 

Inheritance supports code reusability by allowing shared properties and functions/methods to be defined in a _base_ or _super_ class and having _sub_ classes inherit this state / behaviours and extend them if they wish.

We can even allow a sub class to override the behaviour it inherits from its super class - this is called _polymorphism_ (meaning 'taking many forms').

### Inheritance in an airport domain

Looking at our airport system we have 2 types of travellers - Passengers and Crew Members. Both share common properties such as a name, passport number, seat number and the bags they take when they travel. We can use inheritance to define a base class which holds these common features plus an `addBag()` function/method and allow the Passenger and Crew Member class to inherit these. Let's call this base class `Traveller`.

<img width="368" alt="subclasses passenger and crew member inheriting from a super class traveller" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/152109221-841e6503-2b53-40b8-82ed-1104378c92ff.png">

A Traveller will have a name and a number of bags. The Person and Crew Member classes can inherit these properties by simply extending Traveller.

```javascript
class Passenger extends Traveller {
    ....
}
```

Now when we create a new Passenger we will be able to call `addBag()` as this functionality has been inherited from the `Traveller` class. 

Note that we need to take care when defining our constructor as we need to pass up to the super class, the properties which belong there. We do this using the `super` keyword.

|Javascript|Typescript|Java|
```javascript
class Passenger extends Person {

    constructor(name, passportNumber, seatNumber) {
        super(name, passportNumber);
        this.seatNumber = seatNumber;
    }
}
```
```typescript
class Passenger extends Person {

    private seatNumber:string

    constructor(name:string, passportNumber:string, seatNumber:string) {
        super(name, passportNumber);
        this.seatNumber = seatNumber;
    }
}
```
```javascript
public class Passenger extends Person {

    private String seatNumber;

    public Passenger(String name, String passportNumber, String seatNumber) {
        super(name, passportNumber);
        this.seatNumber = seatNumber;
    }
}
```

Our passengers might want behaviour specific to them like `callAttendant()`. In this case, we add the function/method to the `Passenger` subclass.

```javascript
const Traveller = require('./Traveller')

class Passenger extends Traveller {
    callAttendant() {
        console.log('Excuse me, hey there!')
    }
}
```

### Determining the type of a class
In your code you'll want to know what type an object is. For example, you might want to know, is this a `Passenger` or a `Crew Member` I am dealing with? You can use `instanceof` keyword to tell you.

```javascript
test('is an instance of a Passenger', () => {
    const betty = new Passenger('Betty', 'ABC123', '1A')
    expect(betty instanceof Passenger).toBeTruthy()
})
```
```java
@Test
public void isCorrectInstanceOf () {
    Passenger betty = new Passenger("Betty'", "ABC123", "1A");
    assertTrue(betty instanceof Passenger);
}
```

## Assignment
* Change your code to make `CrewMember` and `Passenger` inherit from a `Traveller` class. Add properties and methods relevant to the super class and sub classes.
* Refactor the `Plane` class to board both Passengers and Crew 
* Ensure you have tests which cover all your refactorings
* Commit all your code and a screenshot of your coverage report into Github and share the link with your coach for review.
