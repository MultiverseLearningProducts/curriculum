# The Software Development Life Cycle

## Learning Objectives

## Lesson
The purpose of the software development life cycle (SDLC) is to specify a set of steps which guide us in translating business requirements into operational IT systems.

The 7 stages of the SDLC are listed below.

TODO - add diagram

|**Stage**|**Purpose**|
|---------|-----------|
|Feasibility Study|Determine if the project is worthwhile|
|Requirements Analysis|Obtain the user requirements|
|Design|Design the system|
|Development|Write the code|
|Testing|Test the software|
|Deployment|Deploy the software|
|Maintenance|Support the software|

### Feasibility
A feasibility study evaluates a project's potential for success. 

The idea for a project can come from a number of different places.

*   Market forces from competitors
*   New technologies
*   Changes in regulations
*   Identifying a gap in the market

For example modern banking apps like Monzo and Starling introduced the ability to freeze a debit card from an app. Other banks saw this and reacted to the competition by implementing this same feature for their own customers. This is an example of a SDLC being driven by business needs.

A feasibility study considers the following:
* Business feasibility e.g.
   * can we get the project out ahead of our competitors?
   * does the project fit with our organisational culture/goals?
* Technical feasibility e.g.
   * do we have suitably skilled developers?
   * do we have infrastructure to support the rollout?
* Financial feasibility e.g.
   * can the project be done within budget?
   * will there be an acceptable return on investment?

Here is an example [Esports Feasibility Report](https://www.hereeast.com/documents/18/HEREEAST-210125_Esports_Feasibility_Report_Final.pdf) which discusses the use of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London as a venue for supporting the growth in the gaming industry.

Once the Feasibility Study is complete, a Business Case document is produced after the which details the justification for undertaking the project including costs, risks and benefits. 

Here is an example [Business Case for Heathrow Airport North West Runway](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/374664/evidence-base-heathrow-north-west-final.pdf).

### Requirements Analysis
This stage of the SDLC is about working out exactly what needs to be built or purchased in order to deliver the business impacts and benefits defined in the feasibility stage. 

We covered Requirements Analysis in Module 1 - Unit 1.

### Design

The purpose of the Design stage is to formulate a solution or software specification to realise the system's requirements. The chosen design is elaborated in sufficient detail to to allow developers to implement it.

The system designer/architect will be constrained by the non-functional requirements of the system such as:
* budget
* timescales
* performance requirements
* requirements for using specific technologies
* security requirements

They will also be affected by the quality of requirements and the availability of stakeholders for clarification of requirements.

Let's look at some architectures from companies using Amazon Web Services (AWS) components. Listen closely to how non-functional requirements impact how the architecture is designed.

We can use a _UML Component Diagram_ to represent architectural components, e.g. https://dzone.com/articles/solution-architecture-vs-software-architecture

Here is a very simplified architecture diagram created using a UML Component Diagrams for our SoFresh system.

We can then drill down into more detail by modelling the classes involved in the system and representing them using a _UML Class diagram_ and then using a _UML Sequence diagram_ to show the interactions between them.

We can use an [Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagrams) to model relationships between database tables. 

### Development
The purpose of the Development stage is to build and/or assemble (high-quality) software components to meet a design.

Coding standards help us to develop better quality code by specifying best practices.

Nowadays, default language specific coding standards are incorporated into Interactive Development Environments (IDEs). Visual notifications of non-conformance help us fix code as we go, rather than relying on manual checks at the end of the development process. 

![IntelliJ compiler warning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/142285886-811efd5b-00a5-4fae-9f45-4711bf9c7843.png)

Code reviews look at the static code and detect bugs, vulnerabilities and "code smells". 

One very popular automated code review tool is [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/). SonarQube includes thousands of automated static code analysis rules.

![Example Sonar Qube rule](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/142284540-6294c674-5cef-4cc2-a485-775265ac7eb6.PNG)

Manual code reviews are still really important, we often use `git Pull Requests` to do these.

![Example Pull Request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/142287329-6d434f59-739e-49ee-8824-8a8de1a5ef68.png)

### Testing
The purpose of testing software is to ensure the quality of the system is as high as possible by removing:

1. _Errors_ - mistakes made by humans
1. _Defects_ - bugs in software code
1. _Failures_ - stopping the system from doing something it should

We will cover this in more detail later.

## Deployment
The purpose of the Deployment stage is to make a new system operational. This is achieved through the transfer of the tested software modules to the **live** environment, along with setting up of the data required for the new system.

TODO

### Maintenance (Support)
The maintenance stage is where deployed software is supported and enhanced. We discover whether the business case that initiated the software development life cycle is realised and discover how decisions made during the design and development stages impact the longevity of the system.

Software needs to be maintained for the following reasons:

*   New user requirements
*   Market forces
*   Problems, bugs, incidents
*   Regulatory changes
*   Platform changes

In this video we hear how NASA engineers used problem solving to return the Apollo 13 astraunants safely back to Earth after an explosion in an oxygen tank caused a loss of oxygen, water, electrical power and the loss of use of the propulsion system.
