## Lesson
### Web Servers
What is a server? The simple answer is a computer that provides services to other computers.For example, an office might have a 'file server' a computer where office workers can read and write files that can be accessed by any other computer on the network.

A 'web server' responds to requests for a website's <em>static</em> content. Static content is usually read from disc; it is the <em>same</em> on every request and for every user e.g. HTML, CSS, JSON or image files. 

A web server recieves and responds to requests via HTTP (the HyperText Transfer Protocol).

### HTTP basics

HTTP is fundamental to data exchange on the Web. Whenever you issue a URL from your browser to get a web resource using HTTP, e.g. http://www.nowhere123.com/images/food.jpg, the browser turns the URL into an HTTP request message and sends it to the HTTP server. 

HTTP messages are simply text documents with a uniform structure.

The HTTP request is made up of the following parts:
  * Method - this defines the operation the client wishes to perform. The most commonly used methods are GET (to retrieve data) & POST (to create data).
  * Path - the path to the resource that will be retrieved / updated
  * Version of the HTTP protocol
  * Host header - name of the host server
  * Other headers (optional) - convey extra information for the web server e.g. the type of content being sent
  * Body (optional) - data (e.g. from HTML forms) may be sent in the body

The HTTP response is made up of the following parts:
  * Version of the HTTP protocol
  * Status code & textual description
  * Headers (optional) - convey extra information for the web server e.g. the type of content being sent
  * Body (optional) - the resource that was requested

> Try it yourself: Turn on Chrome `Developer Tools` and click on the `Network` tab. Navigate to different websites and study the HTTP requests and responses being made.

### Express as a Web Server
In this lesson we are going to focus on creating a web server using the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework for Node.js.

To use Express, we firstly need to install the module using `npm install express`. Then we create a JavaScript file (in this example we'll call it `server.js`) and add code to start up a web server listening on a specific port. 

```javascript
const express = require('express');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.static('public'));

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```
In the code above we configure the server to serve static assets from the `public/` folder and to run locally on port 3000.

We can now create some static content for our web server to return. `index.html` is the default page a web server will respond with when requests are made to the root endpoint of the server (i.e. to `http://localhost:3000`). We'll therefore create an `index/html` with the following content and save it to the `public/` folder:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```
To start the web server, run the command `node server.js` in the root directory of your project. You should see a message logged indicating your web server is running. Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to see your 'Hello World' HTML page.

We can serve different kinds of files from our public folder. For example, a `.css` file or a JavaScript file. Let's add some style to our HTML page using a `style.css` file e.g.

```css
body {
    background-color: green;
}
```
We'll update our `index.html` file to use this style sheet.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```
> Notice the `"/style.css"` is not a file path, it is a URL. The browser will actually read this URL as `http://localhost:3000/style.css`. Try pasting that URL into your browser and you'll see the content of your CSS file.

Now, when a request is made to our web server for the `index.html` page, when that page loads in the browser it will make a request for another file, our `style.css` file. Using `Developer Tools` in your Chrome browser you should be able to see both HTTP calls in the `Network` tab. One HTTP request has generated an additional HTTP request. Notice how each request has a status code against it, these [HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) indicate whether or not the call was successful. 

> Why might our HTTP calls return 304 status codes rather than 200?

> Visit your favourite websites with Chrome Developer Tools enabled. Can you see how a single HTTP request spawns multiple other HTTP requests? What kind of assets are being requested?

Note that your web server is only accessible locally, to enable it to serve your HTML page to another computer you would need to explicitly configure the server to be publicly available (not recommended unless you understand how to properly secure it!).

## Assignment
  1. Create a [new Node.js project](/curriculum/Bootcamp/FAQ#createNewProject) for this assignment

  1. Install Express using `npm install express`

  1. Use the instructions above to create a web server running on port 3000, serving static content from a `public` directory within your project
  1. Validate that you see the files being loaded in the `Network` section of your browser's `Developer Tools`. Look at the HTTP status codes, what happens to them when you refresh?
  1. Now try creating additional HTML pages and link them using anchor tags e.g.
       ```html
       <a href="/about.html">About me</a>
       ```
  1. Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review

### Assignment extension tasks
Research what HTTP codes may be returned from a web server and in what situation each occurs. Visit your favourite websites with Chrome Developer Tools enabled and see what HTTP status codes are returned on each call. In what scenario might you expect to see a 404 returned?
