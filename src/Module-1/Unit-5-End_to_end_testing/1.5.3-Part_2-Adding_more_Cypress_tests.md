# Adding more Cypress tests

At this point we have a test in our product test file that tests if the out of stock functionality works and hopefully your coding challenge testing the footer was successful. Now it's time to add some more products tests. We will then turn our attention to testing the nav bar.

## Learning Objectives

- Use Cypress commands to repeat tasks
- Write more test and gain more test coverage

## Product testing prep

Each Product component has an "Add to cart" button that adds the product to the cart and changes the text of the button. Adding the product to the cart belongs, for the most part, to the cart module in Vuex and the data is rendered in the nav bar (i.e 'Cart (1)'). For that reason, for now we'll simply test whether the button state changes and that that functionality works as intended for our users.

In order to do this we need to add a mechanism that adds one or more of the products to the cart. Now this sounds like a useful piece of functionality that we would want to reuse and fortunately in Cypress, we can leverage the commands file (cypress/support/commands.js) to add a command.

In your commands file, add:

```js
Cypress.Commands.add('addProductsToCart', () => {
  cy.get('[data-cy=product--addToCart]').each(($el, index) => {
    $el.click();
  });
});
```

You'll be familiar with `cy.get` at this point. Notice that we get the `product--addToCart` elements. This means we need to add an attribute to each button as follows:

```html
<!-- Product component -->

<button
  v-on:click="addToCart(product)"
  v-if="product.stockLevel > 0"
  data-cy="product--addToCart"
>
  {{ product.addedToCart ? "Remove from cart" : "Add to cart" }}
</button>
```

Prefixing with `product--` is just a useful way to say that the `addToCart` element belongs to the product component. This helps us keep track of our attributes.

Moving on, you'll notice that we then call the `each` function on each button element and we call `click()` on each one. We can not reuse this command whenever we needed to.

We can now call our command in our test:

```js
it('should change the button text when clicked', () => {
  cy.addProductsToCart();

  cy.get('[data-cy=product--addToCart]').each(($el, index) => {
    expect($el).to.contain('Remove from cart');
  });
});
```

## Testing the Add to cart button

To test all of the buttons, we can grab all of the elements, loop through them and then test if they contain the string 'Remove from cart'.

This is the full code:

```js
it('should change the button text when clicked', () => {
  cy.addProductsToCart();

  cy.get('[data-cy=product--addToCart]').each(($el, index) => {
    expect($el).to.contain('Remove from cart');
  });
});
```

If you run your tests now, you should find that the tests pass.
