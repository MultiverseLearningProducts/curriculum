# OpenID Connect

## Learning Objectives
* Understand the difference between OAuth and OpenID Connect
* Know that Auth0 can store usernames and passwords on your behalf 
* Set up Auth0's universal login


## Lesson
OAuth deals specifically with <em>authorization</em>. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a protocol which is built on top of OAuth 2.0 and focusses on user <em>authentication</em>. It is widely used to enable user logins on websites and mobile apps.

OIDC allows apps to verify the identity of the end user and obtain basic profile information such as name and email address. This profile information is held within another JWT known as the ID token.

> Use https://jwt.io to find out the name and email hidden in this JWT ID token `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkZyZWQgRmxpbnRzdG9uZSIsImVtYWlsIjoiZnJlZC5mbGludHN0b25lQHdoaXRlaGF0Lm9yZy51ayIsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.DlHfHG2qZXpWszZv-X8LwoQkZUlqVgaXoRmnHXE2y_I`

## Implementing authentication using Auth0
In this lesson we will store our usernames and passwords in Auth0. This is not strictly necessary as Auth0 supports connecting to other datasources to vaidate credentials, however, doing so simplifies our implementation. 

### Adding usernames & passwords to Auth0
Navigate to `User Management->Users` and choose to `Create User`. Enter the credentials and click `Create`. Repeat for any other users you have. Note that Auth0 will take care of hashing the passwords for you.

### Creating a login page
Auth0's login page can be integrated into many different types of apps including mobile, single page apps and regular web apps. For this lesson we will choose to add login/logout and profile functionality to a "regular web app".

1. Using the Auth0 Dashboard, navigate to `Applications` and choose to `Create Application`. Choose `Regular Web Applications`.
1. Follow the wizard and select
    - Node.js(Express)
    - EXPLORE SAMPLE APP
    - SAVE AND DOWNLOAD APP
    This will create a new application called `My App` in the Auth0 Dashboard and will download the code for a sample web app as a zip file. You can read more about how the sample web app works [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/express).

1. Navigate to the Auth0 Dashboard `Applications->APIs` and authorise `My App` to have access to the Messages API. 
1. Extract the zip and import the code into VSCode
1. Edit the `.env` file to include your app specific settings (these will be visible in your Auth0 Dashboard under `Applications->My App`). You may also need to change the PORT if it clashes with the port your API is running on.
1. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to avoid details of your Auth0 account being saved to git.
1. Follow the instructions to start the sample application, then navigate to `http://localhost:`YOUR_API_PORT_NUMBER. The following web page should be displayed.

1. Clicking "Login" will display the [Auth0 Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login) page

1. Enter the username and password you added to Auth0 and you should now be successfully logged in

1. Select "Profile" to view your user profile information. This information is held in a JWT ID token called `req.oidc.user`.

Well done, you have successfully authenticated a user using OIDC!

## Assignment
In the previous lesson you used OAuth to secure your Messages API. In this lesson you used OIDC to implement user authentication and add login/logout functionality to a web app. Now we need to connect the two parts!

In this assignment you are required to extend your web app to call the Messages API only if the user is logged in.

You will need to modify the `server.js` file config section to be as follows.
```javascript
const config = {
  authorizationParams: {
    response_type: 'code',
    audience: 'messagesAPI',
  },
  authRequired: false,
  auth0Logout: true,
  clientSecret: process.env.SECRET, 
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  clientID: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
  issuerBaseURL: process.env.ISSUER_BASE_URL
};
```
You can then use the following code to call the Messages API.

```javascript
    // retrieve the access token
    const { token_type, access_token } = req.oidc.accessToken; 

    // call the API with the access token
    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:8080/messages`, {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `${token_type} ${access_token}`
      }
    });
    const message = await response.json();
    console.log(message)

  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
```

One the integration is complete, commit your code to GitHub and share the link with your coach for review.
