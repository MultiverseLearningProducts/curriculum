# CSS Flexbox Layout

## Learning Objectives
Understand how and when to use the CSS Flexbox Layout

## Pre-requisites

## Lesson
**TODO - THIS LESSON IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!**

Flexbox (short for Flexible Box Layout Module) enables the design of responsive layout structures without requiring [float](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats) or [positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning).

Flexbox lays out items in one dimension using rows or columns. Items 'flex' or shrink to fill space appropriately.

We specify the use of a flex container using the following CSS, applied to the parent element of the flex items.

```css
display: flex;
```

We specify either a row or column layout using:

```css
flex-direction: column;
```
or
```css
flex-direction: row;
```


TODO - complete the rest of this lesson and add some nice diagrams!



## Assignment
TODO - create a Nav bar for restaurant with e.g. Home/About/?? Ideally with content that will stay regardless of what page you are on. Provide them with some starter HTML and don't use Handlebars as we will introduce this in Unit 5.
