# Foundations -> Unit 1 -> 1.1

## Before we start
You must have familiarity with basic JavaScript concepts, specifically:
  * [JavaScript Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_syntax.asp)
  * [JavaScript Data Types](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp)
  * [JavaScript Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)
  * [JavaScript Arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp)
  * [JavaScript Array Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp)
  * [JavaScript Arrow Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp)
  * [An overview of Node](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-node) - also watch the first 5.30 minutes of [An Introduction to Node in Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIQgVdoYb0M)
  * There is a great article on the [Community Hub](https://community.multiverse.io/topics/16826/feed) which compares statically typed languages (like JavaScript) and dynamically typed languages (like Java) - well worth a read!

You must also be confident using Git to clone, add, commit and push to your Git repository.

## Overview of the Unit

Day one enables the cohort to get their computer set up so that they can write JavaScript using Node.js. We introduce the concepts of Arrays, Objects and functions in Javascript.

# 1.1.1 Setup (could also be done prior to course)
(Note that if students are unable to install software to their computer, it is possible to use the online editor [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) to create and run JavaScript and Node.js instead).

Please install the following:
   * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - this is a code editor
   * [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Check if this is already installed by typing `node` on a Command Promt. If not, then select the LTS version. 
   * Enable `Auto Save` in VSCode via `File -> Auto Save`
   * Install [JsDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) (an API documentation generator for JavaScript) by typing the following command in your command prompt after you have installed Node: `npm install -g jsdoc`
   * Ensure you have the Chrome browser installed

Validate your setup as follows:
  1. Create a new folder called `coursework` under the `Documents` folder in your home directory
  2. Open VSCode and select `File->Open Folder` - select your `coursework` folder
  3. In the `coursework` folder, create a new file (`File->New File`) called `script.js` with the following content: 
```js
console.log('hello from JavaScript');
```
  4. Check your code has been saved by looking at the timestamp for the file in `File Explorer`
  5. Using a Command Prompt, type `node script.js`. You should see the console log output. Here we are running the JavaScript server-side, i.e. within Node.
