# GitHub Projects

## Learning Objectives
Understand how to assign & track progress of projects tasks using GitHub Projects.

## Lesson
You can use Github's 'Projects' page to create and manage your team's work. On your Github repo go to 'Projects' and create a new project (e.g. '2021-02-03 Sprint 1') choosing 'Automated Kanban with reviews' as a template.

You can then create 'Issues' and assign them to this project and to members of your team. Issues can be moved from one column to another. Refer to this [GitHub Project Management Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff5cBkPg-bQ) video.


### Assignment
  1. Ask one of your team members to create a new public GitHub repository (with a README.md) and [add the other team members as 'Collaborators'](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). 
  1. Create a new, clean directory locally and 'Clone' the new repository to this directory. Ensure you can see the 'README.md' file.
  1. Create a new 'Project' as described above, choosing 'Automated Kanban with reviews' as a template
