# Introduction

Now that we've added another component, our `add-to-cart` event will no longer emit back to the app component as the Home component is now rendering the products. To fix this, we'll need to emit the event twice so it gets back to the main app component.

If you're thinking that emitting an event twice could get tricky to manage, you're spot on. Later, when we integrate Vuex, we won't need to emit any events at all, however, emitting events and passing props in this way is a common framework pattern and one that you would use for smaller apps, so it's great to know.

Here's what our new set-up will look like:

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to emit events through two levels
- Find and fix a problem in our app

## Fixing the Add to cart event

### Step 1

We're already emitting the event from the Product component, so our first port of call is to add some code in the Home component to handle the emit from the Product component. In your Home component, add the following method to the methods object:

```javascript
updateCart(productId) {
  this.$emit('update-cart', productId);
}
```

### Step 2

Then in your `index.html`, your router view needs to be modify to register an event with the Home component:

```js
<router-view v-bind:products="this.products" v-on:update-cart="updateCart" />
```

And that's it! You should find that the event emits up two levels while passing along the product ID. this then gets pushed to the cart array in the main app component.
