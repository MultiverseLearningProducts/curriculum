# Introduction

You've worked hard to get your frontend app up and running and now is the time to write some tests!

## Why test at all?

Testing is the process of trying to discover and fix both expected and unforeseen bugs in our software.

Whilst our app in its current state is relatively simple, imagine if it were to connect to an API, add more pages with more functionality, add a fully operational cart component and more. As the application grows, bugs are likely and could affect both the new functionality as well as the existing functionality.

In addition, as our application grows, manually testing it will be out of the question due to the sheer amount of time it would take to test everything. Many organisations now have a CI/CD pipeline. This means regular integrations and releases that depend on automated testing.

## What is E2E testing?

End-to-End testing, as the name suggests, is the strategy we use to ensure all of the components and dependencies of your app come together, from the backend to the front, to output what a user would expect.

We will be using the Cypress testing framework to create run our tests, which combines a suite of integration tests in order to achieve an E2E testing outcome.

## How is E2E different from Unit or Integration testing?
