|Mandy Warren|19/05/2020|Learning objectives not correct?|
|Mandy Warren|19/05/2020|For lesson 2 I did a slight variation. I got them to generate a sample JavaScript app (using Auth0 Dashboard -> Getting Started -> Integrate Auth0 into your application -> Single Page Application) rather than use the "Regular Web Applications" integration. This gave them an out of the box JS/Node app which contained a pre-build web page with Login/Logout functionality. I then asked them to customise this to include a "Call API" button - so they had to obtain the Login token and then call the protected API. This saved them having to modify their existing APIs which made things simpler especially on the Spring Boot side (although they did need to need how to do a Javascript 'fetch' but then you would expect them to know this from Bootcamp). |
|Mandy Warren|19/05/2020|Text after "OpenID connect" a bit confusing and also "Summary" seems to refer to the assignment?|
|Mandy Warren|19/05/2020|There are 2 assignments here - better to have the Banking one as the end of unit assessment (instead of a quiz) so we have a way to assess their knowledge. I gave this as an individual assessment as a) the group were all working in different languages and b) they wanted to work at their own pace and c) I needed to have evidence for how individuals were progressing. Also, do not advise deploying to cloud server and having gmail account details in the code/in GitHub. Instead, send invite manually to sign up. A sequence diagram could help visualise the requirements. |

I can't seem to get the sample banking app to run?
