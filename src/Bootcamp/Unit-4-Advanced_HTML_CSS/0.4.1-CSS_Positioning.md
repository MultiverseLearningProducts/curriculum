## Pre-requisites

- A basic understanding of HTML
- A basic understanding of CSS fundamentals

## Lesson

### Understand the display property

Every element has a `display` property and the default value depends on the type of element. Common display properties are: `inline`, `block`, `inline-block` and `none`. You also have display properties such as `flex` and `grid`, which affect the children of the element (check out the chapters on flex and grid).

To see the display property, just add `display` and the value:

```css
/*
  An anchor is inline by default but we may 
  want it to behave like a block element...
*/

a.block-anchor {
  display: block;
}
```

> You might wonder: why the need for display: none? This is a very useful way to hide elements. Can you think of a scenario where you'd want to do this?

- Inline elements are elements that group together on the same line. Top/bottom margins are ignored, as are height/width properties. Examples include: anchors, span and img.

- Block elements render on their own line. Margins and height/width properties are applied. Examples include: div, h1, p and form.

- Inline-block elements render on the same line, but behave like a block element.

### Understand the position property

As we've learnt, every element has a display property. The position property is the same; each element has a default position property (known as `static` positioning) that can be overridden.

#### Static positioning

As mentioned, static position is an element's default position. This means no positioning has been applied and the element will be rendered as an inline or block element as required.

```css
div.static {
  position: static;
}
```

#### Relative positioning

Elements positioned relatively are positioned relative to their static position. Here you have access to the top, right, bottom and left properties to effectively move the element around as you see fit.

```css
div.relative {
  position: relative;
  left: 30px;
}
```

#### Fixed positioning

Elements that are positioned using the fixed property are positioned relative to the viewport (i.e the boundaries of the browser/app) and always stay in the same place, even when scrolled. Similar to relative positioning, the top, right, bottom and left properties are available to you.

```css
div.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}
```

> Have you seen fixed positioned elements on the web? Where was it being used?

#### Absolute positioning

Elements positioned absolutely render relative to their first positioned (not static) ancestor. What this means is that an absolute element positioned within a relative, absolute, etc, element will be positioned relative to that element. If no positioned ancestor can be found, the element will be placed relative to the browser/app viewport.

Again, you have access to the top, right, bottom and left properties to position the element as needed.

```css
div.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

#### Sticky positioning

The last position we will look at is sticky. This position toggles between relative and fixed positioning to "stick" an item to the top/bottom/edge of the screen as you scroll.

```css
div.sticky {
  position: -webkit-sticky;
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}
</style>
```

> What element could you sticky position on a website?

You can check our sticky positioning in action [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_position_sticky)

Note: Internet Explorer doesn't support position sticky and Safari requires a `vendor prefix` in order to work. A vendor prefix is a custom declaration that enables functions to work in specific browsers.

## Assignment

Taking the email template you wrote in the Fundamentals lesson, can you add the following:

- A "burger" menu to the top right of the viewport (plus some space to bring it away from the edge)
- Add a small logo to all three of your news sections. Position the logo so it's top left or top right of the section

### Assignment extension tasks

- If you explored semantic elements in the previous lesson's extension tasks, have a go at making a sticky `<header>`
