# Events and adding to cart

You've done some amazing work getting to this point! You've created your own Product component and we're now rendering products on the page dynamically. You also know how to change the state of a component. Now it's time to take a look at events and specifically, how we can emit an event to add a product to the cart.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how events work
- Add products to the cart

## Learn how events work

You'll notice that we've got the 'Full details' and the 'Add to cart' buttons, but neither of them work because we haven't wired them up. Let's rectify that and wire up the Add to cart button so it adds the Product to the cart.

### Step 1

In your `Product` component add an event listener and event handler called `addToCart` to the `<button>` element. When we click on the button we'll see that product logged in the console. Below are the code snippets. Use the `Img` component as a reference for how to add this to your `Product` component.

```javascript
const addToCart = (product) => {
    console.table(product)
}

<button onClick={addToCart(props.product)}>
    Add to cart
</button>
```

### Problem solving

Now we have a problem to solve. In the data that we import from our `products.json` file there is a property called 'cart' that is an Array. We need to push the product into the cart array, but the cart exists in the data object that belongs to the `App` component that is outside the scope of our `Product` component.

There are a number of ways to solve this and two examples are:

- pass down a function into the child component 'Product' from the parent component `App` that the child calls with a value from it's own scope.
- Use a centralised state management tool like Redux 

Using Redux at this point is a little overkill as there are only three components in our app. For that reason, let's pass a function down the component tree into the child component from the parent. We'll incorporate Redux later when our app becomes more complex

Let's visualise the process in a diagram:

|Data Flowing Down|Passing Data Up|
|:------------:|:-------------:|

So far we have only passed data down the component tree in one direction. Now we are going to go in the opposite direction and pass data up the component tree. To do this we are going to pass our parent _setState_ function into a child component for it to call with the values it has within it.

### Passing Data Up the Component tree

Create a _reactive_ variable within the `App` component that will be the cart.

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react'
import data from './products.json'
import { Product } from './Product'

function App() {
  const [cart, setCart] = useState(data.cart)

  const addToCart = product => {
    setCart([...cart, product])
  }

    console.log(cart)
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {data.products.map(product => <Product product={product} addToCart={addToCart} />)}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App
```
Our updates are:

1. import `useState` from 'react'
1. create a _reactive_ variable called `cart` and setter called `setCart`
1. create an `addToCart` function that will receive a product and add it to the array of items already in the cart
1. pass the `addToCart` function down into the `Product` component

Now we can call this within the `Product` component like this. You can remove the `Product` component's version of `addToCart`, we are calling the `addToCart` function passed down to us from the `App` parent component with our instance of a product.

```javascript
<button onClick={props.addToCart(props.product)}>Add to cart</button>
```

## Assignment - Coding challenge

Does it work?

- Can you display the _number_ of items in the cart on the screen?

The problem we have now is that you can continue to click the button and the product will get added to the cart array over and over again.

- Modify the `addToCart` method in your app component so that it checks whether the product _already_ exists in the cart array.

- The product data object has a property called `addedToCart` which is a Boolean. Can you insure this is updated as the item is added/removed from the cart

- If an item is in the cart the button should show a different label instead of 'Add to cart' it should say 'Remove from cart'

- Clicking on the 'Remove from cart' button should remove that product from the cart
