# Events and adding to cart

You've done some amazing work getting to this point! You've created your own Product component and we're now rendering products on the page dynamically. You also know what methods and computed properties are and how they work. Now it's time to take a look at events and specifically, how we can emit an event to add a product to the cart.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how events work
- Add products to the cart

## Learn how events work

You'll notice that we've got the 'Full details' and the 'Add to cart' buttons, but neither of them work because we haven't wired them up. Let's rectify that and wire up the Add to cart button so it adds the product IDs to the cart.

### Step 1

In your product component, modify the button as follows:

```html
<button v-on:click="addToCart(product)">Add to cart</button>
```

The `v-on` tells Vue to add an event listener to the button and to run the `addToCart` method on click. If you're familiar with JavaScript events, you'll appreciate that this is a nice efficiency gain as you no longer need to write and manage events yourself.

### Step 2

Add a new method to the methods object in the product component to handle the click:

```javascript
// Product component

addToCart(product) {
  console.log(product);
}
```

Refresh your page and click one of the Add to cart buttons. You should see the product logged to the console.

### Problem solving

Now we have a problem to solve. We need to push the product's ID into the cart array, but the cart exists in the data object that belongs to the main component. For security and data integrity reasons, we can't directly access it via the product component. There are a number of ways to solve this and two examples are:

- `Emit` an event up to the main component and pass up the ID to a method that can add the product ID to the cart

- Use a centralised state management tool like Vuex

Using Vuex at this point is a little overkill as there are only two components. For that reason, let's emit an event and solve the problem that way. We'll incorporate Vuex later when our app becomes more complex

Let's visualise the process in a diagram:

### Step 3

In your `index.html` file, add a `v-on` line to your product component render tag:

```javascript
<product
  v-for="product in this.products"
  v-bind:key="product.productId"
  v-bind:product="product"
  v-on:add-to-cart="updateCart" // Register the 'add-to-cart' event
></product>
```

### Step 4

Head back to your `addToCart` function in the product component and add:

```javascript
// Product component

addToCart(product) {
  this.$emit('add-to-cart', product.productId);
}
```

Here we emit the event back up to the main component using the event `add-to-cart`. The main component receives this signal, and fires the `updateCart` method, which receives the product ID.

### Step 5

Now in your main component, add the following method into the methods object:

```javascript
// Main component

updateCart(productId) {
  this.cart.push(productId);
  console.log(this.cart);
},
```

Notice here we simply push the ID into the cart, then log the cart array (you can remove the console log later). If all has gone well you should see the product ID added to the cart and the cart value in the header incrementing.

We can now get our button to react to the changes by adding the following ternary operator:

```html
<button v-on:click="addToCart(product)">
  {{ product.addedToCart === true ? "Remove from cart" : "Add to cart" }}
</button>
```

## Assignment - Coding challenge 1

The problem we have now is that you can continue to click the button and the ID will get added to the cart array over and over again.

- Modify the `updateCart` method in your main component so that it checks whether the ID _already_ exists in the cart array

- If it doesn't exist, push the ID into the array and return

- If it does exist, use a method to find the array item and remove it
