## Learning Objectives
* Present the menu data from the list of restaurants in a separate page
* Create a new route to support access to this page

## Lesson
We want to read what is on the menu for these lovely looking restaurants. For that level of detail we need to alter the view so we are just looking at one restaurant at a time. In this lesson we are going to create a page for each individual restaurant.

### Dynamic links

To be able to click on a restaurant card and then view that restaurant's page we need to create a dynamic link. We are going to do this by wrapping our restaurant card in an 'anchor' tag. We then make the `href` point to a particular address on our server. Update your cards like this:

```html
<h1>Restaurants</h1>
<section>
    {{#each restaurants}}
        <a href="/restaurants/{{this.id}}">
            <article>
                <header style="background-image: url({{this.image}});">
                <main>{{this.name}}</main>
                <footer>{{this.menus.length}} menus</footer>
            </article>
        </a>
    {{/each}}
</section>
```
As you hover over each card can you see the URL it links to in the bottom left-hand corner of your Chrome browser? Clicking this link will cause a 404 error, as that page or resource does not exist yet.

```sh
Cannot GET /restaurants/2
```

### New Route

To deal with this new request we need to add a new route on our server. Not just any route, the last part of our route is going to be different depending on which restaurant we are clicking on. We need a route that also has a route parameter. Add the new route below to your server.

```javascript
app.get('/restaurants/:id', async (req, res) => {
    console.log("get restaurant with ID:", req.params.id)
    res.send()
})
```
Like before, we add a new route but in the string definition of the route we indicate a route parameter `/:id`. We can now read that value in our route handler using `req.params.id`. What do you think we are going to do with this id?

### New template

Before we get our data, let's create the new template for this view. In the `views` folder, add a file called `restaurant.handlebars`. Add some HTML so you know you have wired the route up to the template ok. Can you pass the correct arguments to your `res.render()`?

Now we can focus on getting our data for this view.

```javascript
app.get('/restaurants/:id', async (req, res) => {
    const restaurant = await Restaurant.findByPk(req.params.id)
    const menus = await restaurant.getMenus({
        include: [{model: MenuItem, as: 'items'}],
        nest: true
    })
    res.render('restaurant', {restaurant, menus})
})
```
### 2 levels of iteration

This view of a restaurant requires us to iterate over the array of menus, and within each menu we iterate over that menu's array of items. WOW!

```html
<h1>{{restaurant.name}}</h1>
<section>
    {{#each menus}}
        <article>
            <h2>{{this.title}}</h2>
            <dl>
                {{#each this.items}}
                    <div>
                        <dt>{{this.name}}</dt>
                        <dd>Â£{{this.price}}</dd>
                    </div>
                {{/each}}
            </dl>
        </article>
    {{/each}}
</section>
```
Finally we have some menus, the fact we are using the same elements in the same order means our CSS is already being applied. The `<dl>` element is a 'description list' you can read more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl).

To get the item name and price to line up nicely like below we can use Flexbox. TODO.

```css
dl div{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 1rem;
}
```
