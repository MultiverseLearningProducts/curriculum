# Rendering Dynamic Content

## Learning Objectives

* Implement Handlebars configuration from a code example (see below)
* Use Handlebars to demonstrate parsing data in a template and include an example of iteration
* Realise pre-designed examples of UI in dynamic HTML 

## Pre-requisites
* Unit 4

## Server-side Rendering

At present the server that we built in Unit 4 exposes our data model via a set of RESTful endpoints. Those endpoints return JSON. Now we are ready to start building a user interface in the browser it would be really useful to return our JSON data rendered within an HTML template.

This is called server-side rendering because we are rendering our data into HTML templates on the server. We'll then send the result to the requesting client. We are going to use a popular templateing engine called [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

### How does HTML templating work?

If we start with data like this:

```json
{
    "restaurants": [
        {
            "name": "Theo's Pizza",
            "image": "http://theos.image.jpg"
        },
        {
            "name": "Patsies Pastries",
            "image": "http://patsies.image.jpg"
        }
    ]
}
```
We have an array of data here that we want to render in HTML. The way of doing this with Handlebars is to create a template that will enable us to iterate over our array of data and repeatedly add the same parsed HTML block to our HTML. This is how dynamic lists of content are rendered.
```html
<section>
    {{#each restaurants}}
        <article>
            <img src="{{this.image}}"/>
            <h2>{{this.name}}</h2>
        </article>
    {{/each}}
</section>
```
The `{{}}` syntax is like a curly handlebar moustache, hence the name Handlebars. These mark the boundaries of a piece of dynamic content that is to be slotted into that location from the data we are passing the template. These handlebar templates are like functions that take some HTML template, some data, and return the phased HTML. The above example will return the following HTML.
```html
<section>
    <article>
        <img src="http://theos.image.jpg"/>
        <h2>Theo's Pizza</h2>
    </article>
    <article>
        <img src="http://patsies.image.jpg"/>
        <h2>Patsies Pastries</h2>
    </article>
</section>
```
This is very much like 'mail merge' in Word. 

### Set up Handlebars in express

Here is a configuration example that you can use as a reference. Try to set this up so you are able to return templates for the following 2 routes:

1. `/web/restaurants` - should return a page displaying the first 5 restaurants
1. `/web/restaurants/:id` - this should return a page for a single restaurant

#### Folder structure

```sh
views
├── restaurants.handlebars
├── restaurant.handlebars
└── layouts
    └── main.handlebars
```
The views folder contains Handlebars templates which get rendered into layouts. A layout is an HTML page with a `{{{body}}}` placeholder into which views are rendered. The layouts folder typically holds a default `main.handlebars` layout. The`1main.handlebars` layout should look something like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        {{{body}}}
    </body>
</html>
```
and you can create a `restaurants.handlebars` in the views folder and for now try adding this
```html
<section>
    There are {{restaurants.length}} restaurants.
</section>
```
#### Dependencies
```sh
npm install handlebars express-handlebars @handlebars/allow-prototype-access
```
#### Example Configure
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const Handlebars = require('handlebars')
const expressHandlebars = require('express-handlebars')
const {allowInsecurePrototypeAccess} = require('@handlebars/allow-prototype-access')

const app = express();

// setup our templating engine
const handlebars = expressHandlebars({
    handlebars: allowInsecurePrototypeAccess(Handlebars)
})
app.engine('handlebars', handlebars)
app.set('view engine', 'handlebars')

// serve static assets from the public/ folder
app.use(express.static('public'));

// this route returns HTML for all the restaurants
app.get('/web/restaurants', async (req, res) => {
    const restaurants = await Restaurant.findAll()
    res.render('restaurants', { restaurants })
})
// this route returns HTML for a single restaurant
app.get('/web/restaurants/:id', async (req, res) => {
    const restaurant = await Restaurant.findByPk(req.params.id)
    res.render('restaurant', { restaurant })
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:3000`)
})
```
The initial set up is somewhat convoluted but the extended capability you now have is to be able to call `res.render` with a string that is the name of the `.handlebars` template you want to use, and an object with your data for that template. What that render function will return and send to the client is HTML populated with your data.

## Client-side javascript

We don't need to create all the functionality of our web page on the server. There is dynamic content that we can create and update in the browser once the HTML has been loaded. We are going to explore that in the next lesson.

## Assignment

* Setup Handlebars on your server
* Create a route and template that returns all the restaurants
* Create a route and template that returns a single restaurant (don't worry about showing its menus yet)
* Implement your designs from our previous session as closely as you can
* Submit an image of your original design and what you built with Handlebars in a side by side comparison in the slack channel
