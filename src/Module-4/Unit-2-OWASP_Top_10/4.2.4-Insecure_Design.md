# Insecure Design

## Learning Objectives

* Understand what insecure design is
* Understand how to ensure your designs are secure

## Insecure Design

Insecure design is, as the name implies, where the vulnerability is as a result of flawed design rather than flawed implementation. As an example, let's imagine an app with a "Forgot your Password" button. When clicked, the user is asked a security question (e.g. "What was your paternal grandmother's first name?"). This is insecure design: a hacker might know the user's grandmother's name. Knowing the name does not authenticate the user. However well this design is *implemented*, it is still insecure.

## Preventing Insecure Design

* Unit and integration test misuse of your application
* Create or identify a set of secure design patterns for your product to use
* Integrate security language and controls into user stories
* Limit resource consumption by user or service (e.g. rate limiting)
