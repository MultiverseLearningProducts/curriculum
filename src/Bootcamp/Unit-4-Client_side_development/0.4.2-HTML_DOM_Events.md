## Lesson
### The HTML DOM
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates an Object Model of the web page. To illustrate this, let's create a DOM representation of this HTML:

```js
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        <section>
            <p id="intro">Introduction</p>
```

![DOM representation of HTML with elements and atributes shown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/106388095-cc7ea300-63d4-11eb-94c5-bf25553a8968.png)

To access an element in an HTML page, you always go via the `document` object.

The most common way to access HTML elements with JavaScript is via their id, e.g.

```js
<script>
    const myElement = document.getElementById("intro");
</script>
```

The most common way to retrieve/change the content of an element is by using the `innerHTML` property, i.e.

```js
<script>
    document.getElementById("intro").innerHTML = "Background";
</script>
```

You can also change the value of an attribute using:

```js
<script>
    document.getElementById("intro").setAttribute("href", "/style2.css");
</script>
``` 

### The HTML DOM Event object
JavaScript's main primitive is the `Object`. Let's create a simple HTML button that triggers a JavaScript `event` object.

```html
<button id="my-button" onclick="console.log(event)">Click me</button>
```

What kind of `event` is triggered? What else can you learn about the event that just happened? Where on earth does the `event` that we are console.logging come from anyway?

The `event` object (and it must be named 'event' not 'evt', 'e' or anything else) is injected by the browser into every event handler. In this example, we are using the HTML attribute `onclick` with a string value of the JavaScript we wish to run when the event is triggered. We can also have a named function defined in our `main.js` file and include that in the string of JavaScript that is run when the event is triggered.

```javascript
function myButtonHasBeenClicked(event) {
    console.log(event)
}
```
```html
<button onclick="myButtonHasBeenClicked(event)">Click me</button>
```

### Event Listeners & Event Handlers

`onclick` is an 'event listener'. It listens for clicks. An event listener will have a companion called an 'event handler'. `myButtonHasBeenClicked` is an 'event handler'. 

There are other ways to attach event listeners to elements in the DOM. For example, the code below is another way to do the same thing we are doing above, but just using JavaScript.

```javascript
const button = document.getElementById('my-button');

button.addEventListener('click', myButtonHasBeenClicked);
```

Here, we use the DOM to navigate to the button via its id. Instead of adding the event listener inline, we add it to the instance of the element in JavaScript. We call `addEventListener` with 2 arguments, a string that is the name of the type of listener and the function to call (with the event object) to handle the event.

You can remove an event listener as follows:
```javascript
button.removeEventListener('click', myButtonHasBeenClicked)
```

### Types of listeners

## Assignment
To experience events in JavaScript you are going to create your own adventure game.

  1. Visit the website [Creepy Events](https://codepen.io/prosetech/pen/oRxMmZ). Your objective is to wire up the JavaScript functions to the buttons and input boxes to complete the story.
  1. Create a new directory for this assignment
  1. Create your own simple adventure game (similar to the Creepy Events site) which makes use of the following HTML DOM events: 
      * onclick()
      * onmouseover()
      * input()
      * focus()
      * keydown()
      * keyup()
      * mouseenter()
      * resize()
    1. Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review

  ### Assignment extension tasks
  Extend your game to include other HTML DOM events.
