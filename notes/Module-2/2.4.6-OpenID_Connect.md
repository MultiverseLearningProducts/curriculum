|Mandy Warren|19/05/2020|Learning objectives not correct?|
|Mandy Warren|19/05/2020|For lesson 2 I did a slight variation. I got them to generate a sample JavaScript app (using Auth0 Dashboard -> Getting Started -> Integrate Auth0 into your application -> Single Page Application) rather than use the "Regular Web Applications" integration. This gave them an out of the box JS/Node app which contained a pre-build web page with Login/Logout functionality. I then asked them to customise this to include a "Call API" button - so they had to obtain the Login token and then call the protected API. This saved them having to modify their existing APIs which made things simpler especially on the Spring Boot side as the generated code used older/differing versions from our code. This kept the login/logout functionality separate from the API server which is more akin to how you would develop an app. |
|Mandy Warren|19/05/2020|Text after "OpenID connect" a bit confusing and does "Summary" seems to refer to the assignment as it mentions banking?|
|Mandy Warren|19/05/2020|There are 2 assignments here - better to have the Banking one as the end of unit assessment (instead of a quiz) so we have a way to assess their knowledge. I gave this as an individual assessment as a) the group were all working in different languages and b) they wanted to work at their own pace and c) I needed to have evidence for how individuals were progressing. Also, although the old notes mention to NEVER commit passwords to version control, the new notes don't. It worries me having gmail account details in the code/in GitHub/on a Cloud server which gets forgotten about hence I did not get my cohort to do the emailing. I also asked them to produce a sequence diagram (including the User, the Banking App, Auth0 and the BankingAPI) which illustrated the process of logging in and sending a token to access the Banking APIs. This really helped their understanding and we could validate the design before they started coding.|

I can't seem to get the sample banking app to run?
