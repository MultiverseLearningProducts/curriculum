# Overview of Standards and Assessments 

Welcome to the Software Engineering Programme (SWE)! We are excited you are joining Multiverse to start your apprentice journey. Before you start, we want to give you a little more information on how you will be assessed and what the learning will look like. This programme is composed of the following: 

* [__5 week Bootcamp__](/curriculum/Bootcamp/index.html) prepares you to enter the workplace ready for your first challenges. The course content covers the entire software stack and includes, Object Oriented Programming (OOP) using JavaScript, the Unified Modelling Language (UML), RESTful APIs, relational databases and rendering dynamic content in the browser. You will also be introduced to the basics of the software development life cycle and begin to understand the role of a software developer. Each lesson includes coding challenges and the final week of the Bootcamp culminates with a group project.

* __Module 1:__ In this module, you will focus on designing, building and optimising a front-end, with UX, Web accessibility and performance considerations. You will also learn how to critically evaluate and utilise front-end frameworks (such as Angular, React, Vue).

* __Module 2:__ The module builds and expands on the RESTful concepts introduced in the 5-week Bootcamp. As well as designing and developing APIs, you will secure endpoints using both Basic Authentication and OAuth. Concepts will be taught in a language independent manner to allow coding in the language/framework of your choice.  

* __Module 3:__ This module takes the output from the first half of the software development life cycle (tested software) and teaches the knowledge and skills needed to package and deploy that software into different environments. The module strikes a balance between understanding the theories and methodologies of software deployment and the set of technical skills to actually design and implement a deployment and maintenance strategy.

* __Module 4:__ This module introduces the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top Ten Web Application Security Risks and how to mitigate against them. By the end of this module, you will understand the impact of deploying insecure software and how to protect against the most common form of attacks at all stages of the software development lifecycle.

## How will you be assessed?

During your sessions with your coach you will work on a variety of assignments. Below is a list of some of the ways you may be assessed in the programme.  

* Projects to be completed after the day of learning 
* Short answer questions around understanding of software engineering concepts 
* Scenario based questions around your role as a developer 
* Questions evaluating your role in the business with your learning 
* Individual projects you will complete throughout a module 
* Group projects you will complete throughout a module 

## Standards of Software Engineering

All the Bootcamp and Module content taught during the Software Engineering Programme is directly aligned with the [standards for the Level 4 Software Developer programme](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/software-developer-v1-1) as designed by the Institute for Apprenticeships & Technical Education. Refer to this programme regularly to reflect on what you are learning and identify areas for development whilst on the job. The standards are also summarised below: 

### Technical Competencies

- Logic: writes good quality code (logic) with sound syntax in at least one language
- User interface: can develop effective user interfaces for at least one channel
- Data: can effectively link code to the database/data sets
- Test: can test code and analyse results to correct errors found using either V-model manual testing and/or using unit testing
- Problem solving: can apply structured techniques to problem solving, can debug code and can understand the structure of programmes in order to identify and resolve issues
- Design: can create simple data models and software designs to effectively communicate understanding of the program, following best practices and standards
- Analysis: can understand and create basic analysis artefacts, such as user cases and/or user stories
- Deployment : can understand and utilise skills to build, manage and deploy code into enterprise environments
- Development lifecycle: can operate at all stages of the software development lifecycle, with increasing breadth and depth over time with initial focus on build and test.
- Can apply good practice approaches according to the relevant paradigm (for example object oriented, event driven or procedural)
- Can interpret and follow:
  - software designs and functional/technical specifications
  - company defined ‘coding standards’ or industry good practice for coding
  - testing frameworks and methodologies
  - company, team or client approaches to continuous integration, version and source control
- Can respond to the business environment and business issues related to software development
- Can operate effectively in their own business’s, their customers’ and the industry’s environments
- Can apply the maths required to be a software developer (e.g. algorithms, logic and data structures)

### Technical Knowledge and Understanding

- Understands and operates at all stages of the software development lifecycle
- Understands the similarities and differences (taking into account positives and negatives of both approaches) between agile and waterfall software development methodologies
- Understands how teams work effectively to produce software and contributes appropriately
- Understands and applies software design approaches and patterns and can interpret and implement a given design, compliant with security and maintainability requirements
- Understands and responds to the business environment and business issues related to software development
- Understands and applies the maths required to be a software developer (eg algorithms, logic and data structures)

### Underpinning Skills, Attitudes and Behaviours

- Logical and creative thinking skills
- Analytical and problem solving skills
- Ability to work independently and to take responsibility
- Can use own initiative
- A thorough and organised approach
- Ability to work with a range of internal and external people
- Ability to communicate effectively in a variety of situations
- Maintain productive, professional and secure working environment
