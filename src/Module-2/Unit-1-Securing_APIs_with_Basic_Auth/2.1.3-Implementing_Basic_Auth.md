# Authentication & Authorisation

## Learning Objectives
* Understand the difference between authentication and authorisation
* Understand how a username and password is sent in the Basic Authentication HTTP scheme
* Secure an API using Basic Authentication

## Lesson

### Authentication v. Authorisation

 > `Authentication` is the process of verifying who a user is. 

 > `Authorisation` is the process of verifying what they have access to. 

Here's an example to illustrate this: 

Imagine you have booked a hotel room. When you get to the checkout you are asked for you driving license to prove who you are - this is **authentication**. 

![hotel checkin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/102709159-a9be8200-429f-11eb-903b-12976c1f051d.png "Icons made by catkuro from https://www.flaticon.com")

Once authentication is complete, you are given a key card which gives you entry to your room - this is **authorisation** as you are being granted access to a resource (in this case your room). You are not authorised to access any other rooms.

In RESTful APIs, a failure to authenticate results in a 403 (Forbidden) HTTP status code. A failure to authorise results in a 401 (Unauthorized) HTTP status code.

> Which of the following are examples of authentication and which are examples of authorisation?:
   1. Showing your passport at the airport
   2. Determining which floor in a building an employee can access
   3. Entering a PIN into an ATM 
   4. Giving a staff member access to a printer
   5. Entering a username and password to access Facebook
   6. Using biometrics (such as fingerprints) to unlock your laptop

### Basic Authentication

When we create APIs we need to consider how we will secure access to them. One way is to require a username and password before granting access, this is known as `Basic Authentication`. 

Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme that is built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends an HTTP request with an `Authorization` header that contains the word `Basic` followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password

Here is an example:
> Authorization: Basic ZnJlZC5mbGludHN0b25lQHdoaXRlaGF0Lm9yZy51azpteXBhc3N3MHJk

That long string of numbers and letters after the word "Basic" is a Base64 encoded string. You can encode and decode Base64 strings in your browser console using a pair of functions called `atob` and `btoa`. 

> Try to decode the user name and password passed into the Authorization header above.
> Can you see any issues with passing Base64 encoded user names/password over HTTP? How could you address these issues?

### Implementing Basic Authentication
When the application server receives the `Authentication` header, it needs to decode it and validate the credentials match those stored. 

This logic is typically performed in a "middleware" interceptor / handler prior to the request being processed. Middleware interceptors / handlers are used for many different use cases including security, logging and error handling - they allow us to implement non-functional requirements centrally, independent of the request processing logic.

### Assignment
Using your specific language framework, secure your Messaging API with Basic Authentication, validating the incoming username and password against hashed credentials created in the previous lesson. The Additional Resources section below shows example configuration for Java Spring Boot and Node.js Express implementations.

Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review.

## Additional resources
The following code snippets illustrate how to enable Basic Authentication for Node.js Express and Java Spring Boot.

|Javascript|Java|
```javascript
// check for a basic auth header with correct credentials
app.use(basicAuth({
  authorizer: dbAuthorizer, // customer authorizer,
  authorizeAsync: true, // we check the db which makes this async
  challenge: true,
  unauthorizedResponse: (req) => {
    return `unauthorized. ip: ${req.ip}`
  }
}));

// our custom async authorizer middleware, this is called for each request
function dbAuthorizer(username, password, callback) {
  const sql = "select password from users where username = ?;";
  db.get(sql, [username], async (err, user) => {
    err ? callback(err) : bcrypt.compare(password, user.password, callback);
  });
```
```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private DataSource dataSource;

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {
        // do not use the line below in production apps!!
        httpSecurity.csrf().disable(); // hack to support DELETE method
        httpSecurity.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and().httpBasic();
    }

    @Autowired
    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder authentication)
            throws Exception {
        // use jdbc authentication (for in memory authentication use authentication.inMemoryAuthentication())
        authentication.jdbcAuthentication()
                .dataSource(dataSource)
                .authoritiesByUsernameQuery("select username,authority "
                        + "from authorities "
                        + "where username = ?")
                .usersByUsernameQuery(
                        "select username, password, 'true' as enabled from users where username = ?");

    }

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        // specify we want the password hashed using bcrypt
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
```
