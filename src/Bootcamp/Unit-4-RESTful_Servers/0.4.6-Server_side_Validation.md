# Server side Validation

## Learning Objective
- Understand the importance of server-side validation to protect malicious requests

## Pre-requisites

- Familiarity with express routing

## Lesson
Most websites have client-side validation in place. For example, a sign-up form may disable the submit button until all the fields have been filled in. However, client side validation can be subverted either by disabling JavaScript in the browser, or, by using a tool such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to call the API directly, bypassing the form.

> Listen to this [short video (3mins)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVJ2ukke34s) which explains why this can be a problem. Also think back to Unit 3 when we discussed [SQL injection attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection). 

In this lesson you are going to use [Express validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/) to add some server side validation to ensure that a user cannot send in malicious input which could expose sensitive data or hack your application. 

To install Express Validator run:

`npm install express-validator`

Require this in your `server.js` file
```js
const { check, validationResult } = require('express-validator');
```

You can now add validation to your route, for example, to `escape` any HTML characters in the restaurant name field:

```js
app.post('/restaurants', [
    check('name').not().isEmpty().trim().escape()
    ], async (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req)
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() })
    }
```

## Assignment
1. Use the [express validator](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js#validators) documentation to add server-side validation to your routes. Include validators for the following:
   * checking that the input for the restaurant name contains only characters which appear in a whitelist
   * ensuring that the restaurant image is a URL
   * ensuring that the restaurant name is less than 50 characters

2. Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review

### Assignment extension tasks
Add sensible server-side validation to all of your deleting and updating endpoints.
