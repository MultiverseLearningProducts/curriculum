        <h1>Logical Data Model</h1>
<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Try out <a href="https://planttext.com">https://planttext.com</a> for drawing UML diagrams</li>
<li>Install the <code>PlantUML</code> plugin for VSCode</li>
</ul>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a logical data model using a UML class diagram</li>
<li>Use 'has many' and 'belongs to' to correctly label relationship between classes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson</h2>
<p>Imagine we are going to build a Restaurant application like Deliveroo or Uber Eats. We firstly start by designing our logical data model. An application logical data model is like the foundations of a building. Everything is build on top of this foundation.</p>
<p>In a Restaurant system what are some of the objects you would expect to find?</p>
<ol>
<li>Restaurant</li>
<li>Menu</li>
<li>Item (a dish with a price)</li>
</ol>
<p>What are the relationships between these?</p>
<p>A Restaurant can have many Menus, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>a drinks menu</li>
<li>a mains menu</li>
<li>a dessert menu</li>
</ul>
<p>A Menu belongs to a Restaurant. A Menu has many Items. An Item belongs to a Menu. Can you figure out all of that? It gets confusing and quite complicated to imagine if someone is just verbally explaining it to us. We need a way to visually represent it so we can clearly communicate our design.</p>
<h3>UML</h3>
<p>The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardised way to represent abstract structures in programming.</p>
<p>A logical data model can be represented using an <a href="https://plantuml.com/ie-diagram">Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)</a> which is an extension to the UML Class notation. Associations and 'has many' relationships can be modelled using the appropriate syntax.</p>
<p>Example of Airports in UML</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>Design a logical data model for the following classes. Include the relationships between them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Restaurant</li>
<li>Menu</li>
<li>Item</li>
</ol>
<p>Commit your UML diagram into Github and share the link with your coach for review.</p>
