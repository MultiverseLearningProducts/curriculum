# The Software Development Life Cycle

The function of the software development life cycle (SDLC) is to translate business requirements through a structured set of processes to operational software that delivers services or products.

The role of the SDLC is to remove the unpredictable “human element” and replace it with structured and managed processes. This makes possible the construction of larger more complex IT systems.

It is important to appreciate that the essence of this module is about internalising the formula and systems for creating impact with software.

It’s going to help and support you to deliver your final work place project that will be the main part of your end-point-assessment.

## What are the stages?

![the software development life cycle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/74645922-ba2e3980-5170-11ea-9f62-0fa8f6d594e0.jpg)

It varies a little but the stages of the SDLC are usually as follows:

1. Feasibility
1. Requirements Engineering
1. Design
1. Development
1. Testing
1. Deployment
1. Maintenance

Like a recipe is only a representation of a dish that you could make, a framework is also just a recipe for an outcome. Our task in this module is to learn the labels, learn the patterns, understand the outputs of the SDLC and apply it to our own experiences.

## The inputs and outputs of the SDLC

What follows is a detailed explanation of the different stages of the SDLC in particular we will focus on what the inputs and outputs of each stage is, and how each stage feeds into the next.

!(https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-QyW8D3ei0)

### Feasibility

The inputs for the feasibility study, and in fact the whole SDLC are business needs.

> Management is doing things right, leadership is doing the right things.

#### Feasibility inputs

The initial input to the SDLC can come from a number of different places.

*   Market forces from competitors
*   New technologies
*   Changes in regulations
*   Identifying a gap in the market

This first phase of the SDLC looks at the aims of the business and the environment that it is operating in and asks the question “what should we be doing to fulfil our aims?”.

That might be reacting to competitors. For example modern banking apps like Monzo and Starling introduced the ability to freeze a debit card from an app. Other banks saw this and reacted to the competition by implementing this same feature for their own customers. This is an example of a SDLC being driven by business needs.

During the feasibility study executive staff figure out what their organisation should do next. This period of research and decision making is often dominated by the economic principle of **Return on Investment** (ROI).

> Return on investment (ROI) is a ratio between net profit (over a period) and cost of investment (resulting from an investment of some resources at a point in time). A high ROI means the investment’s gains compare favourably to its cost.

#### Feasibility outputs

The output of this phase is a decision made by the executives running the organisation. A statement "we should do this", or "we need to offer this service" is usually at the conclusion of the process, with data and evidence backing up the recommendations.

### Requirements Engineering

The input to this stage is the executive decision or business aim. This stage of the SDLC is about working out exactly what needs to be build or purchased in order to deliver the business impacts and benefits defined in the feasibility stage. There are a number of roles in this stage that we should be familiar with in order to really understand what this stage is all about.

|Role|Responsibility|
|:---|:-------------|
Project Sponsor|Owns the project is accountable to the organisation for delivery of business benefits (feasibility study) controls the scope of the project
Managers|advise, have a say, own part of the solution
Users|People who use the current system, and will use the new system. Need to articulate their individual processes and buy into the new solution
Project Manager|esponsible for development and deliverable to the Project Sponsor
Business Analysts|Eliciting, documenting, analysing requirements
Testers|Help validate business analysts elicited requirements are testable
Developers|Can consult with business analysts, verify that requirements are clearly defined and add technical detail to proposals

Usually we think about customers as external to an organisation. For example when we buy something from JD sports, we are the customer. Organisation often create software for themselves. That means the software project might be commissioned by and delivered to someone in the organisation. That person is usually referred to as the **Project Sponsor** they are like an internal customer. They will ultimately receive the final product, but they may not use the product themselves, the team or their workers may end up using the product.

> Requirements are not just waiting to be picked from people like apples from a tree. They have to be mined like tin or iron.
<small>“Developing Information Systems” by James Cadle</small>

It’s the **Business Analysts** that will go into an organisation and mine for requirements. How do they do this?

*   Interviews
*   Focus groups
*   Workshops
*   Observations
*   Shadowing
*   Scenarios
*   Prototyping

All of the above methods involve talking to people. There is also another approach that is more data driven.

*   Questionnaires
*   Document analysis
*   Record searching
*   Activity sampling

For example a business analysts might look at a user inputting data in a form and ask what are the current input fields in this form? Why these fields? Where is the input data used? or analysis screen grabs and dissect components. They might also want to know things like how many invoices are filed in a month? How many automated emails sent? When is the system at capacity? Volumetric information like this can help the analysis.

#### Activity sampling

To perform **“Activity sampling”** you do the following: At different times (to generate a fair sample) visit a location or office floor and record what each person is doing. For example:

*   person1: Responding to emails
*   person2: In a meeting
*   person3: Tea break
*   person4: Working on a feature
*   person5: Standup

The set of activity samples when considered together can help provide an impression of what members of the organisation are doing during working hours.

#### Functional and Non-functional requirements

!(https://www.youtube.com/embed/zCX-N1H8Vps)

Both of these are really important. Functional requirements are usually binary. For example in the video clip above talks about a lift. Does the lift take you to another floor, yes or no? If you can tick a box for a requirement it's usually a functional requirement.

Non-functional requirements are usually on a sliding scale or are somewhat subjective. For example the lift's ride is quick. You can't really tick box 'quick'. Quick compared to what? Compared to walking up the stairs? Compared to the lift in the Shard building? You could turn this non-functional requirement of 'must be quick' into a functional requirement by putting a measure in place i.e. the lift should take 3.6 seconds to reach a floor.

#### What makes a “Good” requirement

There is quite an art to form a good requirement. Below are the main qualities your requirement must have:

*   Atomic
*   Uniquely identified
*   Complete
*   Consistent and unambiguous
*   Traceable
*   Prioritised
*   Testable

In this table you can see examples of bad verses good requirements.

|Quality|Bad|Good|
|:------|:--|:---|
|Atomic|Students will be able to enrol to undergraduate and post-graduate courses|<ul><li>Students will be able to enrol to undergraduate courses</li><li>Students will be able to enrol to post-graduate courses</li></ul>|
|Unique id|Students will be able to enrol to undergraduate courses, Students will be able to enrol to post-graduate courses|<ul><li>**0x12** Course Enrolment</li><li>**0x13** Undergraduate enrolment</li><li>**0x14** Post-grad enrolment</li></ul>|
|Complete|A professor user will log into the system by providing his username, password, and other relevant information|A professor user will log into the system by providing his username, password and department code|
|Consistent|A student will have either undergraduate courses or post-graduate courses but not both. Some courses will be open to both under-graduate and post graduate|A student will have either under-graduate or post graduates but not both|
|Traceable|Maintain student information-mapped to BRD [req.ID](http://req.ID)?|Maintain student information-Mapped to BRD req ID 4.1|
|Prioritised|<ul><li>Registered student</li><li>Maintain User Information</li><li>Enrol courses</li><li>View Report Card</li></ul>|<ul><li>1️⃣ Registered student</li><li>1️⃣ Enrol courses</li><li>2️⃣ Maintain User Information</li><li>3️⃣ View Report Card</li></ul>|
|Testable|Each page of the system will load in an acceptable time-frame|Register student and enrol courses pages of the system will load within 5 seconds|

#### Functional Models

Functional models are often a way to illustrate or explain how a system needs to work. Functional Decomposition is the process of breaking down that complexity into smaller functions. Below is an example from [sites.google.com/site/centerofmissingpeople](https://sites.google.com/site/centerofmissingpeople) of functional decomposition.

![an example of functional decomposition](https://sites.google.com/site/centerofmissingpeople/_/rsrc/1480218719774/decomposition-diagram/Functional%20decomposition.png)

The output of Requirements Engineering is a set of requirements that address the business needs identified in the first stage of the SDLC

### Design

The inputs for the design stage are requirements. The purpose of the design stage is to solve the problem of how to realise the requirement. There are 5 types of design we need to consider.

1.  Input output design
2.  Process design
3.  Data design
4.  Security and control design

There are often constraints acting on designers. All of the factors below can impact the design stage of the SDLC.

|Project|Technical|Organisational|
|:------|:--------|:-------------|
Money<br/>Time<br/>Skills|Hardware<br/>Software<br/>Legacy systems<br/>Internal or external regulations or standards|Politics<br/>Stakeholders<br/>Standards<br/>Legislation<br/>Cultural Differences<br/>Quality of requirements

#### I/O design

Input output design starts with requirements. Usually what needs solving is:

*   **How** will we collect inputs?
*   **How** will we store/process inputs?
*   **How** will we output the stored/processed inputs?

For example say we have the following requirements:

1.  Users need to be able to create an account.
    *   1.1 Users need to enter their email to create an account.
    *   1.2 Users need to enter a password to create an account.
    *   1.3 Users need to be be able to submit their email and password to create an account.
2.  Users need to be logged into the application in order to purchase an item.
    *   2.1 Users need to enter both their email and password to log in.
    *   2.2 Users need to be able to submit their email and password to log in.
    *   2.3 It must be clear to the user that they are logged in and a session has started.
    *   2.4 Logged in users need to be able to log out to finish their session.
    *   2.5 Users trying to purchase an item when not logged in need to be prompted to log in and start a session.
    *   2.6 Users who selected an item/s to purchase before logging in should have the item or items they selected still selected after they have logged in.
3.  Users can select items to purchase
    *   3.1 It must be clear to the user how many items they have selected
    *   3.2 It must be clear to the user what the current total of all the items they have selected is.
    *   3.3 Users need to be able to remove items they have previously selected.

What are all the inputs we need from a user in the requirements above?

Once we have identified the inputs from the requirements then we need to design a way to collect those inputs. We need to decide what we should do with those inputs, for example they may need processing, or storing. Then we can design a way to access the outputs for the requirements.

For example we might collect the email and password in a web form, send those inputs to our server. The server can store those inputs (when creating an account), or process them (when logging in). Logging in or creating a session is our first output the server takes an email and password and returns a new session.

#### Use case diagrams

Use case diagrams are a way to express all these inputs and outputs. These diagrams can help designers to express their input output design.

!(https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqFJcX6F43M)

![use case diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/75772283-8ee84480-5d43-11ea-9c95-defd5db09005.jpg)

In the rectangle are the requirements. Around the rectangle are different types of users who either provide inputs or consume outputs. What is interesting about the diagram are the places when the line from a user to a requirement crosses the edge of the rectangle. These intersections are the places that need input output design.

Considering the diagram above can you describe one of the forms that you might need to design? Include in your description the kinds of data your form would have to collect and what might happen to that data.

#### Process Design

To realise requirements sometimes you need to combine a series of processes together. This is process design. Following on from our order system we have just been looking at:

![process diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/75778926-9feb8280-5d50-11ea-8179-519a861ecf95.jpg)

In this example the website is a simple static site hosted on [surge](https://surge.sh), the organisation runs its own bespoke accounting software solution on its own servers. The databases are hosted on AWS (amazon web services) and exposed via a RESTful API. Authentication of http requests is done via a dedicated service which is also hosted on AWS.

To place an order this is the process.

1.  A user requests the website hosted on surge
2.  Surge responds with the website index page
3.  From the website a request with items to order is sent to an Auth service on AWS
4.  That Auth service validates the request then forwards the order onto the API
5.  The API processes the order by reading and writing to the databases
6.  The API responds to the request with a status

A user will be free to select items. Then they will be able to place an order. If they are logged in and have an active session then we will create an Order record, and update the Users orders collection.

##### High level to lower level

Our process design at the moment is quite high level, we can now go into more and more detail as we design the system in more and more detail.

![fractal](https://media.giphy.com/media/5MHFuFtdsKENi/giphy.gif)

For example in the diagram above we have an Authentication step in our process. That might need a more detailed design. Below is an activity diagram that shows how to handle incoming requests.

![activity diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/75785433-a16e7800-5d5b-11ea-9edc-405fb8d53d29.jpg)

##### Data

Next we might want to start thinking about our data structures. In OO (object orientated) programming our data structures are mirrored in code and in the datastore. For example our program might have an **Order** class that we interact with in our program, and each instance of an **Order** is also persisted as a row in a datastore.

Data design starts with the requirements. Once it is clear what needs to be persisted often data is then **_normalised_**.

###### Normalisation

This is a technique in data design. The aim is redundancy-free data structures. That means data structures

*   do not contain data that can be derived
*   only contain one copy of each logical point
*   contain the very latest value for each data item
*   combine items into logical groups based on underlying data dependencies.

A good example of normalisation is the way we can store a one-to-many relationship in a relational database. For example our Customers will have many orders. To normalize that data structure we should store the Customer once. Then use their id in the Orders table to create that relationship.

#### Security and control design

These are the mechanisms we design to ensure the system has integrity. The safeguards we introduce for the inputs and outputs of our system. For example; validating inputs from the user. Restricting write access to certain tables. Restricting read access for certain users.

![ordering system](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/75792946-9240f780-5d66-11ea-9183-389a2758c527.jpg)

The outputs of the design stage might be:

*   Use Case diagrams
*   Process diagrams
*   Data models
*   Class diagrams
*   Control flow diagrams
*   UI/Component/Form designs

### Development

The input to the development stage is designs. These are then implemented by developers who encode the designs. The output of this stage is new software or updated or adapted software.

### Testing

The input to this stage is new software. We are going to go into more detail about testing in Unit 2. In brief the purpose of testing software is to remove

* Errors
* Defects
* Failures

Errors caused by code that is incorrectly implemented. Defects caused by code that works, but does not work in the way it is intended too. Failures cause your software to stop working all together. Testing should be removing these three things from your software.

The output of this stage is tested software.

### Deployment

The input to this stage is tested software. The purpose of the deployment stage is to make new software operational. This is achieved through the transfer of the tested software modules to the operational or **live** environment, along with setting up of the data required for the new system.

As with the requirements stage, below is a table of common roles and responsibilities for people operating in this stage of the SDLC.

|Role|Responsibility|
|:---|:-------------|
Service Manager|Understands impact on service levels, timings, communications
Users|Help to identify training needs. Can advise about best way to transition
Sponsor|Green lights the deployment having weighed up the impacts on business
Business Analysts|Can carry out training. Can advice on business processes to manage impact. Can ensure documentation is available
Technical Specialists|What order to technically do things in.Best methods to actually deal with data migrations.Early life support (developers, tech support)

#### 4 different ways to deploy software

##### The Big Bang

![the big bang method](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/79762545-ce321b00-831a-11ea-8bcf-afc8b7de864a.png)

|Pros|Cons|
|:---|:---|
<ul><li>Clean break</li><li>Everyone start with new system together</li><li>Usually less expensive</li></ul>|<ul><li>High risk if failure</li><li>No going back point fix forward only</li><li>Unanticipated effects</li></ul>

##### Parallel Running

![parallel running two systems](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/79762570-d2f6cf00-831a-11ea-8711-10dfdd721133.png)

|Pros|Cons|
|:---|:---|
<ul><li>Less risk, old system still operates</li><li>Transition users gradually or in phases</li><li>Can validate operations through comparisons</li></ul>|<ul><li>Expensive (have to maintain two systems)</li><li>More complex sharing state across two systems</li><li>Users may not use new system</li></ul>

##### Pilots

![run pilots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/79762573-d427fc00-831a-11ea-823f-0801de8879aa.png)

|Pros|Cons|
|:---|:---|
<ul><li>Trials/pilots to identify potential issues</li><li>Can eliminate problems before full scale deployment</li><li>Can use feedback from pilot to improve the product</li><li>Catching errors early is cheaper and more efficient</li></ul>|<ul><li>Can’t find problems at scale because it is not at scale</li><li>More complex sharing state across two systems</li><li>Pilot software likely to be different to final release</li></ul>

##### Feature releases

![feature releases](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/79762578-d5592900-831a-11ea-9217-76259c1d1411.png)

|Pros|Cons|
|:---|:---|
<ul><li>High priority requirements delivered sooner</li><li>Introduce complexity gradually</li><li>Users can learn at a steady pace</li><li>Can fall back to previous version (without new feature) if there are problems</li></ul>|<ul><li>Users may lose interest in limited early version</li><li>Users may not like new features being regularly introduced</li><li>Users may not use new features sticking to original limited work flows</li></ul>

#### Traceability

A traceability matrix keeps track of the relationship between a requirement and its artefacts (test, code, deployment, version). This way features can be tracked across teams, throughout the SDLC.

![trace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/79765580-b52b6900-831e-11ea-94fd-bea5ea75db17.png)

#### Semantic Versioning (Semver)

Semver is a naming convention for versioning software. Its make of three components:

## 10.13.6

**10** is the Major version  
**13** is the Minor version  
**6** is the patch number

To progress the Major version you would expect breaking changes. Minor version increments indicate NEW features, new functionality, but no breaking changes. The patch number indicates fixes and improvements, nothing new in features or functionality.

# 👩‍💻🧑‍💻

What is the semantic version of your operating system? If you have a Windows computer Microsoft has stopped using sermver in favour of build numbers, try your version of Android or iOS.

The output of the implementation phase is operational software.

### Maintenance

What now? We have live software in production that is addressing a business need. If only that were it! But things change:

*   New user requirements
*   Market forces shift
*   Problems, bugs, incidents
*   Regulatory changes
*   Platform changes

The input to the maintenance phase is production software. This phase mainly deals with:

*   Major enhancements
*   Minor enhancements
*   Error corrections
*   Bug fixes
*   Performance improvements
*   Routine updates and upgrades

## 1st, 2nd, 3rd line support

One aspect of this phase of the SDLC is support. This can take the form of either 1st, 2nd or 3rd line support. Often this kind of support is managed by a system. Let us have a look at how it works.

### 1st line support

Usually a first point of contact when a bug or error is detected. This might be over the phone for example. Often this involves raising a ticket on a system so that your reported incident can be tracked. There may be quick solutions offered for example:

> “have you tried turning it off and on again?”

### 2nd line support

This is usually more involved and often a support professional with domain knowledge will try to solve the problem. This typically involves on-site visits or remote sessions. 2nd line support technicians might escalate a something they are unable to fix to 3rd line support.

### 3rd line support

This level involves the experts. These are the people who actually wrote the software or the network engineers who actually installed a network.

# When things go wrong

It happens. Sometimes software breaks in production.

!(https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmjDwNe0BcE)

Bad. However RBS was able to find what caused the problem. The output of the maintenance stage is operational software that is delivering the business aims in a sustainable way. This is also the output of the SDLC.

## Assignment

* List the stages of the SDLC
* Name the inputs and outputs of each stage of the SDLC
* Summaries the main activity of each state of the SDLC
