# Introduction to Unix

## Portable processes

Docker is a tool that enables developers to package their code to run in different environments. Containers contain processes, and all the dependencies to run those processes. In essence what Docker gives us is portable processes.

In this session we are going to build and run our own containers. Most docker images are build from 'base images' that resemble the various Unix operating systems. This is for lots of reasons; Unix/Linux operating system is open source, unlike Windows and MacOS that require a licence to run. The favours of Unix that docker containers are build from are super lightweight, which makes them easier to store and run on remote computers.

For this reason before we get into Docker it's worth familiarising ourselves with the Unix operating system.

## Unix - What you need to know

This operating system usually runs without a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is built to run software, apps and services on servers. It has 3 parts that we need to know about:

1. The Kernel
1. The Shell
1. The Files

### The Kernal

The kernel of Unix is the hub of the operating system. It allocates time and memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications in response to system calls.

### The Shell

This is how you can interact with the kernel. The shell presents an interactive terminal into which we can type commands. For example we can get the kernel to read all the files in a directory and have them listed in the shell.

```sh
ls -l
```
The shell command above requests that the kernel run the program `ls` the `-l` 'flag' is an option asking for the long format list. The kernel reads the file system and returns the result.
```sh
total 56
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Aug 27 11:05 bin
drwxr-xr-x    5 root     root           360 Sep 15 14:42 dev
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 Sep 15 14:42 etc
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Aug 27 11:05 home

drwxr-xr-x    5 root     root          4096 Aug 27 11:05 media
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Aug 27 11:05 mnt
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Aug 27 11:05 opt
dr-xr-xr-x  183 root     root             0 Sep 15 14:42 proc
drwx------    2 root     root          4096 Aug 27 11:05 root
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Aug 27 11:05 run
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Aug 27 11:05 sbin
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Aug 27 11:05 srv
dr-xr-xr-x   13 root     root             0 Sep 15 14:42 sys
drwxrwxrwt    2 root     root          4096 Aug 27 11:05 tmp
drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root          4096 Aug 27 11:05 usr
drwxr-xr-x   12 root     root          4096 Aug 27 11:05 var
```
### The Files
One of the design ideas behind Unix is that everything is a file. Small programs that do one thing can be used in combination together to do many complex things. For example if you want to change directory, there is a Unix program dedicated to that called `cd`. If you change into the `/bin` folder and list all the files there you can see all the Unix programs listed. Everything is a file, including folders. A folder is a file with a list of other files in it.

Some files are executable and run by the kernel in memory, those processes get a dedicated PID (process ID) which you can use to kill (stop the process) or address from other programs.

In the list of files (that represent folders) above can you see a 10 character string that looks like this:
```sh
drwxr-xr-x
```
These are the permissions of the file and you can read them as follows. The first character indicates file is a folder `d` (stands for directory). If it is a file you will see a hyphen `-`.

#### Owner

The next group of 3 characters represent the owner of the file's access, and they are in order `rwx` which stands for read, write, execute. So if I create a file, I would expect that I can read it, write to it or execute it.

#### Groups

The next 3 characters represent what groups of users can do. Users in Unix can belong to a group, for example you might have a group called 'apprentices'. I can limit access to a file for this group. For example I could removing write access by modifying the permission to `r-x` that means read, and execute. How have I changed the permission? Now if you are in the 'apprentices' group you can read the file and execute it, but if you try to write to that file, the Unix system will not allow it. It will throw an error.

#### Global

The last three characters are the permissions for everyone else. So maybe everyone else can execute the file, but they can't read or write to the file. How would you define those permissions?

### Users

As in most operating systems Unix has users. You create users in the Alpine distribution (based on the Busybox flavor of Unix) with the following command.
```sh
adduser some_username some_group
```
As with lots of Unix shell programes there are options you can pass to `adduser` to see them just use the `--help` flag. You can see all the users by reading the passwd file 
```sh
`cat /etc/passwd`.
```

## Summary

Understanding these aspects of Unix is a pre-requisite for starting to work with docker containers, and begin to containerise your own apps. Try the assignment below and lets start to use docker to explore the Unix Alpine base image.

## Assignment

* Install Docker on your computer
* Run Unix in a container <sup>*</sup>`docker run -it alpine /bin/sh`
* Create a user (with your choice of username)
* Create a group called 'apprentices'
* `login` as your new user
* Download [this file](https://multiverselearningproducts.github.io/curriculum/api-example.yaml) into the home directory of your user (_hint_ `wget --help`)
* Change the owner to your user, the group is the 'apprentices' group (_hint_ `chown --help`)
* Change the permissions to:
    - owner - read, write, execute
    - group - read, execute
    - everyone - read

* Create another user and login as that user (_hint_ `login --help`)
* Navigate to the `api-example.yaml` file and read it (_hint_ `cat --help`)
* Try to execute it `./api-example.yaml` try to write to it `echo "my edit" >> api-example.yaml`

You can log out a user by just typing `exit` you will then be the `root` user again.

\* _this command invokes `docker`, to `run` an `-it` interactive container called `alpine` and when the container starts execute the program `/bin/sh` which is the `sh` (shell program) located in the `/bin` binary folder at the root of the file system. This will give you a Unix environment to play in!_
