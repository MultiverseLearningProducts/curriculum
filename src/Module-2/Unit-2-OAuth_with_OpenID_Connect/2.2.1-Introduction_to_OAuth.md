# Introduction to OAuth

## Learning Objectives
* Know that OAuth uses tokens to secure APIs
* Understand the structure of a JSON Web Token (JWT)
* Understand the OAuth flow

## Pre-requisites
* Install the PlantUML plugin to VSCode to allow you to create sequence diagrams.

## What is OAuth?

OAuth (2.0) is an open standard for authorization. It controls authorization to a protected resource such as an API.

If you’ve ever signed up to a new application and agreed to let it access your Facebook or phone contacts, then you’ve used OAuth. OAuth provides secure delegated access which means an application can access resources from a server on behalf of the user, without them having to share their credentials. It does this by allowing an Identity Provider (we will be using Auth0) to issue access tokens. The token informs the API that the bearer of the token is authorized to access the API.

In a nightclub when you enter and pay your entry fee you will often be stamped or presented with a bracelet to ware on your wrist. This shows the security staff on the door that you have paid, and you can enter and leave the club for that evening. The bracelet or stamp is like a token the club (Identity Provider) has issue. With a legitimate stamp or bracelet the door staff (API middleware) check it and then if its ok let you in (to the controller).

## What makes OAuth secure?
  * Token management means we can track each device that uses the API (and revoke access if we want)
  * OAuth provides 'scopes' which allow for fine-grained authorization 
  * Tokens expire, making it very hard for them to be reused

Let's look at this diagram which illustrates the OAuth flow we are going to be using to secure our API resource:

## JWT 
Whilst OAuth does not mandate any specific format for tokens, the recommendation is to use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). A JWT is easy to identify, it is three strings separated by a `.`

Here is an example:

`eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJtZXNzYWdlIjoiSGVsbG8gZnJvbSBXaGl0ZUhhdCEifQ.XSYkatPu3LirweyU13rLWblqQRNvbqoJJ0qwX_mdYgM`

Use https://jwt.io to see the secret message hidden inside this token! 

**Activity**: Create your own messages and send them to the Slack channel!

A JWT is made up of 3 parts:

* **Header** - specifies the type of token and the algorithm used to sign the token
* **Payload** - the information that we want to transmit and other information about our token
* **Signature** - verifies who sent the token and that the token has not been tampered with

To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

```ruby
SHA1(base64Encode(Header) + "." + base64Encode(Payload), secret)
// SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c <- that is the Signature part
```

## Assignment
1. Sign up to the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). This API uses OAuth to secure it.

1. Choose a selection of [API endpoints](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) (we suggest using GET endpoints to avoid affecting any your playlists) and select to "Try out in Web Console". Enable Chrome Developer Tools and study the HTTP requests made when "Get Token" is selected and when "Try It" is selected. Hint: Enable "Preserve log" so you can see all messages across calls and "Disable cache" so you don't get cached results. 

1. Read the 'Implicit Grant Flow' section of the [Spotify Authorization guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#implicit-grant-flow). This is the OAuth flow used by the Spotify Developer website.

1. Create a sequence diagram which illustrates this OAuth Implicit Grant Flow used by the Spotify Developer website. Add messages which illustrate how tokens are obtained and the flow if the Spotify user is not logged in. 

## Assignment extension tasks
Study the other authentication flows detailed in the [Spotify Authorization guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide). What are the differences between them and in what scenario is each one used?
