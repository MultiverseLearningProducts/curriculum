## Server-Side Request Forgery

Often, web-connected applications are made up of multiple cooperating servers. When a client makes a network request, the request is routed to the main server (which is connected to the internet). However, that server may be part of a local, private network of servers, and the client's request may require the main server to make requests to the other servers in order to satisfy it.

Only the main server can be accessed directly, however, a hacker might be able to trick it into making a request of their behalf to one of the servers on the local network.

## Preventing Server-Side Request Forgery

* Sanitize and validate all client-supplied input data

* Use a positive allow-list the for the URL's schema, port and destination 

* Do not send raw responses to clients

* Disable HTTP redirections
