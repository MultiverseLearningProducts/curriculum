# Continuous Integration & Deployment

You have implemented the testing pyramid! In the SDLC the development phase is followed by testing and after testing comes deployment. As a senior engineer responsible for a product or service you'll want developers to run those tests every time they make changes and definitely run them before deploying those changes. How could you be sure that happened?

You could ask nicely. It might be a better option to systematize the running of tests so it becomes impossible to deploy without the tests being run on your codebase. Then you can deploy with greater confidence. In this session we are going to look at an industry wide practice of building integrated deployment pipelines.

## Pipelines

A continuous integration (CI) pipeline automates the process of deploying software. Often the pipeline connects to version control, and will automate a deployment when code is pushed to the master branch in version control. That deployment process usually involves a number of stages, for example, building the app, testing it, updating version numbers etc and finally deploying it.

In this diagram of a pipeline you can see 3 GitHub repos. Look for a mobile app, and a backend service. All 3 repos when they are pushed to will trigger a series of automated stages including the "System_Tests" stage. If the tests pass, then the code is deployed into a production environment.

## Building your own pipeline

You should have a project from our last session with each type of test in it. Our mission is to create a pipeline that will connect to our github, pull the new code from the repo, run the tests and deploy it to Heroku.

### Version control

If your project is not in version control put it into version control.

### The tests

Have your project set up in such a way that you can run the unit tests with a single command. For example:
```sh
npm run test:unit
```
Do the same for the integration tests and system (end-2-end) tests.

### GOCD

There are lots of different CI/CD pipeline tools to choose from. What follows are instructions to set up GOCD, other providers will follow similar steps, but you will have to read the documentation for those tools to figure out how to replicate these steps.

We are going to set up a 'New Pipeline' connect that pipeline to our GitHub repo, then add a couple of stages to our pipeline. Stage one will run all the tests, stage two will release our code to Heroku.

#### New Pipeline

Click new pipeline and complete the wizard.

1. Material - Your Github
1. Pipeline Name - Name for this integration
1. Stage Details - Test (the name of our first stage)
1. Job and Tasks - `test-unit` lets start with the most simple job

On GOCD each job on each stage is designed to run in parallel. It starts when new commits are added to the master branch of our repo. The pipeline will fetch latest code from the GitHub repo using `git pull` so from here in a fresh environment we will have to run the following 2 tasks in our job:

1. `npm install`
1. `npm run test:unit`

Once this is created you should be able to trigger the pipeline.
