# Populating databases from JSON

## Learning Objectives
How to use JavaScript (Node.js) to load data from a JSON file and populate database tables. 

## Pre-requisites
   * Familiarity with [Database access using Node.js](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-Relational_Databases/0.3.5-Database_access_using_Node.html)

   * Download this [restaurant data file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MultiverseLearningProducts/restaurant-data/master/restaurants.json)

## Lesson
The restaurant data you downloaded is called "seed" data. The data is in a [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp) format.

Here is a representation of a an Airport object from the JSON data:

```json
    {
        "name": "Bayroot",
        "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/Destinations/Europe/England/Brighton/brighton-restaurants-hotel-du-vin-bistro.jpg",
        "menus": [
            {
                "title": "Grill",
                "items": [
                    {
                        "name": "Houmous Shawarma Lamb",
                        "price": 6.50
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Lamb Parcels",
                        "price": 5.70
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Meat Balls (Kebbeh)",
                        "price": 6.50
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Falafel (v)",
                        "price": 5.00
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "title": "Cold Mezza/Starters",
                "items": [
                    {
                        "name": "Houmous",
                        "price": 5.00
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Baba Ganoush (Moutabal) (v)",
                        "price": 5.70
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Stuffed Vine Leaves (Warak Enab)",
                        "price": 5.70
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
```

Key points to note are that:  
  * JSON objects are surrounded by curly braces {}
  * JSON objects are written in key/value pairs
  * JSON arrays are implemented with `[]` syntax 
  * Keys and values are separated by a colon
  * Each key-value pair is separated by a comma
  * Keys must be always be strings and values must be a valid JSON data type i.e. one of string, number, object, array, boolean or null

Looking at the data helps us decide what column names and data types we need to set up in our database. This is called the database schema. We have this already setup.

To insert the data into database tables, we need to firstly asychronously load the file, then iterate over the data and insert it using Prepared Statements. Before we do this, let's use the best practise of Test Driven Development (TDD) and write a unit test.

### Write a failing test
Here is an example of a Jest test which uses the `beforeAll` method to initialise the database with our tables if they don't already exist. The test will fail as we don't yet have a load() function defined. The idea of the failing test helps you think about what you are actually trying to build.

```javascript
const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();
const load = require('./index')

describe('SQLite3', () => {
    beforeAll(done => {
        db.exec('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS restaurants(...);', done)
    })
    test('restaurants are loaded into the database', (done) => {
        load((db) => {
            db.all('SELECT * FROM restaurants LIMIT 3;', (err, row) => {
                expect(row.length).toBe(3)
                expect(row[0].name).toBe('Bayroot')
                db.get('SELECT COUNT(id) AS total FROM restaurants;', (err, count) => {
                    expect(count.total).toBe(8)
                    done()
                })
            })
        })
    })
})
```

### Reading JSON data from a file using Node.js
Reading from a file may take a long time hence it is performed asynchronously. 

Here is one version of a `load()` method which makes use of `async`/`await` to load the data into a JavaScript array, you can also write this using Promises or Callbacks.

```js
const fsp = require('fs').promises; // Node.js file system module with promises

async function load() {
    console.log('calling load');
    // wait for the file to be read
    const buffer = await fsp.readFile('./restaurants.json');
    const restaurants = (JSON.parse(String(buffer)));
    return restaurants;
}
```

## Assignment
   1. Create a [new Node.js project](/curriculum/Bootcamp/FAQ#createNewProject) for this assignment.

   1. Write a unit test to verify your restaurant seed data has loaded into the database ok. This will fail initially but should pass once you complete the rest of the assignment.

   1. Create a js file (named `initialiseDB.js`) which contains Node.js code to create a new, persistent database containing the tables described by the UML diagram in the [SQL Joins](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-Relational_Databases/0.3.4-SQL_Joins.html) lesson. Ensure you create FOREIGN KEYs as appropriate. 

   1. Create a js file (named `populateDB.js`) which contains code to load the restaurant JSON data and recursively insert each Restaurant, Menu & MenuItem into the database. You will be looping through a [multi-dimensional array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multidimensional-array-in-javascript/). Remember to use `try/catch/finally` blocks to handle errors and close both the statements and database.

   1. Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review.

### Assignment extension tasks
* Add additional unit tests to simulate exception conditions such as the seed file not being found or the database table not existing.
