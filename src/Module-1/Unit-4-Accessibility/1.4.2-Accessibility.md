# Accessibility

## Learning Objectives
* Know which organisation governs the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
* Explain the 4 principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
* Explain what laws exist in the UK and US to enforce accessible websites
* Evaluate how conformant a website is against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

## Accessibility
In the [Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit Manual](https://download.microsoft.com/download/b/0/d/b0d4bf87-09ce-4417-8f28-d60703d672ed/inclusive_toolkit_manual_final.pdf), accessibility is defined as _"The qualities that make an experience open to all"_.

The result of the inclusive design process is accessible products.

_Web_ Accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the web equally. The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) are governed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and are internationally recognised. They are built around four principals:
  1. **Perceivable** - information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
  2. **Operable** - users must be able to navigate the content
  3. **Understanding** - content should be presented in clear and simple language
  4. **Robust** - content must be able to be interpreted by a variety of different assistive technologies

Listen to this video from the [W3C Web Accesssibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits/) to find out more about Web Accessibility and the benefits it brings.

The [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-2.html) defines access to content on the Web as a basic human right. 

The UK [Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/made) came into force for public sector bodies on 23 September 2018. Public Sector websites are required by law to meet accessibility standards. 

US Government websites must meet [Section 508 regulations](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies). This requires all electronic and information technology developed, procured, maintained, or used by the federal government must be accessible to people with disabilities. 

Although there is no UK or US law requiring non-government/public sector websites to comply to accessibility standards, it is strongly recommended. Designing for accessibility brings other benefits such as: 
* improved Site Engine Optimation (SEO) - Google ranks accessible sites higher
* opportunities to reach more users 
* enhanced public image for your brand

## Checking website accessibility

WCAG defines [3 levels of conformance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview), Level A, Level AA and Level AAA. UK public sector and US government websites must meet Level AA. Level AAA compliance is difficult to achieve across the whole of a website as it includes requirements  such as sign language interpretation for audio or video content, therefore companies should aim to reach AA compliance.

There are a number of commercial and free tools which can be used to audit a website for conformance to WCAG standards. One opensource tool is [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) which is built into Chrome Developer Tools. Lighthouse checks for most of the WCAG Level A and Level AA rules with a few exceptions.

Some of the common issues Lighthouse will report are as follows:
|**Issue**|**Meaning**|
|---------|-----------|
|Image elements do not have `alt` attributes|Not all users can see the images on your website. Vision impaired users may be using screen readers which will "speak" the `alt` tag to describe the image|  
|Contrast|Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio|
|Links do not have a discernible name|Links must have a unique name. Where images are used on links, these must have `alt` text|

Lighhouse will explain which HTML element fails the audit and how to resolve the issue.

## Assignment
* Run Lighthouse against all pages on your website. Note that Lighthouse needs to be run against each individual webpage. Store the generated reports in GitHub so your coach can see what issues need to be resolved.

* Make the appropriate code changes to fix each issue. Re-run Lighthouse to check each issue is fixed. Store the final report in GitHub so your coach can see what issues were resolved.
