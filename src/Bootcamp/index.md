# Bootcamp
The Bootcamp prepares new apprentices to enter the workplace ready for their first challenges. We introduce the software development life cycle and begin to understand the role of a software developer. As well as learning the basics of programming in HTML and JavaScript, apprentices take on coding assignments and gain practical experience of the entire software stack.

For frequently asked questions about the technical assignments in the Bootcamp, please see the [Bootcamp FAQ](/curriculum/Bootcamp/FAQ).

## Unit 1 - Object Oriented Programming
This unit introduces test driven development (TTD) and Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Apprentices will create a series of objects in their program and then write the code so these objects interact with each other through inheritance and association. They will also be introduced to asynchronous JavaScript functions.

* [JavaScript Objects and Functions](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-1-Object_Oriented_Programming/0.1.1-JavaScript_Objects_And_Functions)
* [Test Driven Development](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-1-Object_Oriented_Programming/0.1.2-Test_Driven_Development)
* [Objects in an Airport Domain](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-1-Object_Oriented_Programming/0.1.3-Objects_in_an_Airport_Domain)
* [Static functions and properties](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-1-Object_Oriented_Programming/0.1.4-Static_functions_and_properties)
* [Inheritance](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-1-Object_Oriented_Programming/0.1.5-Inheritance)
* [Asynchronous JavaScript](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-1-Object_Oriented_Programming/0.1.6-Asynchronous_JavaScript)
* [Asynchronous Airport Data Load](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-1-Object_Oriented_Programming/0.1.7-Asynchronous_Airport_Data_Load)
* [Scooter Hire System](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-1-Object_Oriented_Programming/0.1.8-Scooter_Hire_System)


## Unit 2 - Databases
This unit introduces object oriented analysis and design (OOAD) using the Unified Modelling Language (UML). Apprentices will also learn SQL (using SQLite as a simple database) and use Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tools to create applications that can persist their state.

* [Logical Data Model](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-2-Databases/0.2.1-Logical_Data_Model)
* [Implementing the Logical Data Model](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-2-Databases/0.2.2-Implementing_the_Logical_Data_Model)
* [Basic SQL Commands](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-2-Databases/0.2.3-Basic_SQL_Commands.html)
* [SQL Joins](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-2-Databases/0.2.4-SQL_Joins.html)
* [Database access using Node.js](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-2-Databases/0.2.5-Database_access_using_Node.html)
* [Populating databases from JSON](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-2-Databases/0.2.6-Populating_databases_from_JSON.html)
* [Object Relational Mapping - part 1](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-2-Databases/0.2.7-Object_Relational_Mapping_part_1.html)
* [Object Relational Mapping - part 2](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-2-Databases/0.2.8-Object_Relational_Mapping_part_2.html)
* [Sequelize - part 1](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-2-Databases/0.2.9-Sequelize_part_1.html)
* [Sequelize - part 2](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-2-Databases/0.2.10-Sequelize_part_2.html)

## Unit 3 - API development
This unit introduces the RESTful design pattern and how to create APIs to create, read, update and delete resources using Node.js Express middleware. Apprentices will use templating frameworks to create dynamic content in web pages and learn how to create responsive applications. They will develop a full-stack restaurant website to showcase their skills.

* [Web Servers](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-API_development/0.3.1-Web_Servers)
* [Application Servers](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-API_development/0.3.2-Application_Servers)
