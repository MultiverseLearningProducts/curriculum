## Lesson

Developers use frameworks to help them organise their code. When lots of people work on a codebase, having a pattern to follow makes it much easier for team members to join and add to the code. We are going to use a simple framework called AppRun. If you can use AppRun you will find learning React or Elm much easier.

Before we look at the framework, let's think about the design pattern that underpins React, Elm and AppRun.

![state view update pattern](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/95664104-a2ab2300-0b3c-11eb-8afd-233463f0218d.png)

Both Elm and Redux follow the same pattern. Your app has state (this is the data Model). You app renders a view of that state. The view can trigger updates to some or all of the state. That state update triggers a re-render and your view is redrawn to represent the new state. This kind of programming style is called 'event driven'. It is 'declarative' like a spreadsheet.

![example of a spreadsheet updating](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/95664166-3f6dc080-0b3d-11eb-9885-a55e42acf475.gif)

Think about how a spreadsheet works. Once your spreadsheet is all setup (or 'declared'), if you change a value in one cell it can trigger updates to other cells that depend on that value. AppRun works like this.

### Load AppRun

To load AppRun, we simply create an HTML page with the content below. This loads the AppRun library in a `<script>` tag from `unpkg.com`. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/apprun/dist/apprun-html.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <main id="app"></main>
        <script src="main.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### State
State in AppRun is simply a plain JavaScript object. All the data in our app belongs here. Our 'TODO list' will be a simple array which holds all our tasks.

We'll create a `main.js` file to hold the state:

```javascript
const state = {
    tasks: []
}
```

### View

To display the tasks we need a `view` function. This function will receive the `state` object (i.e. list of tasks) and will return a string of HTML. This is like the templating we did with Handlebars, but AppRun's template syntax employs the full power of JavaScript expressions, while Handlebarsâ€™ syntax is quite limited in comparison.

```javascript
const view = state => `
    <section>
        <h2>Tasks</h2>
        <ul>
            ${state.tasks.map(task => `<li>${task.text}</li>`).join("")}
        </ul>
    <section>
    <section>
        <form>
            <input name="text" placeholder="Add a task" />
            <button>Add</button>
        </form>
    </section>
`
```

Remember the `view` function is just JavaScript, so you can add branching logic, iteration, calculation and other functionality. We will end up with a string of valid HTML that will get added to the root HTML node (the `<main id="app">` element).

### Update

We want to be able to add a task. This requires us to capture the form submission, get the form data, create a task and add that into the state. Our update object will be the ONLY thing that interacts with the state. This is the most tricky part of AppRun to understand.

```javascript
const update = {
    add: (state, form) => {
        const data = new FormData(form)
        const task = {
            id: window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(2)).join(""),
            text: data.get('text'),
            status: 0
        }
        state.tasks.push(task)
        return state
    }
}
```
What is going on here? We have a JavaScript object. The properties are the names of update functions. In the example above we have defined the 'add' update function. Every update function will receive the state as its first argument. It is injected (like the event object). If we give our update function an argument, that will appear as the second argument. In this example, we pass in the form instance. 

We use `new FormData(form)` to de-serialize the form data, then create a new object that represents a task with a random id (generated via `window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(2))`). We then update the state and finally, as we must in each update function, we return the new version of the state.

This update will trigger a re-render of our view function.

### Event listeners
For this to work we need to add an event listener to our view and add the update function as the event handler.

```html
<section>
    <form onsubmit="app.run('add', this); return false;">
        <input name="text" placeholder="Add a task" />
        <button>Add</button>
    </form>
</section>
```
What event are we listening for? Notice we call `app.run('add', this);` <em>this</em> is the form. We return `false` as this will prevent the default behaviour of the form submission reloading the page! 

With all this declared, we are ready to initiate our app. Add the following to your `main.js`

```javascript
app.start('app', state, view, update)
```

## Assignment
  1. Create a new directory for this assignment
  1. Implement the state -> view -> update design pattern
  1. Can you complete the CRUD operations for each task?
  1. Use the id property to make a status update to 1 indicating that the task has been completed.
  1. Use the id property to delete a task, you should only be able to delete a task once it has been marked as done.
  1. Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review
