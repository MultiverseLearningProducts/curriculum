# Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

## Learning Objectives

* Understand what Security Logging and and Monitoring Failures are
* Understand how to protect against Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

## Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

When suspicious activity does occur on a system, it is important that this information is logged and that these logs are appropriately monitored. In the extreme case where a breach does occur, it's important that the system is able to detect this and notify its administrators.

Examples of logging and monitoring failures include:

- failing to log important events such as failed-logins, money-transfers etc.

- failing to properly log when errors have occured on the system

- failing to detect or log suspicious activity or security breaches

- failing to monitor logs for suspicious activity

## Preventing Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

* Ensure all failures of login, access control, and server-side input validation are logged.

* Ensure suspicious activity is logged with enough user-context to identify malicious accounts.

* Store high-value transactions with integrity controls to prevent tampering, such as append-only database tables.
