### What are User Stories?

User stories are a tool for helping software develops envisage how end-users will interact with their application in its real-world context. User stories often take the following form:

> As a \<role\>, I can \<capability\> so that \<receive benefit\>

For example:

### Who writes User Stories?

Anyone involved in the development of the product can write user stories! Customers, product-owners and developers can all get involved. If the customer isn't involved directly in writing them, they're usually based off conversations with the customer. Once they're written, often the customer will take the set of user stories and decide which to prioritise.

### Why should we write User Stories?

As mentioned, use stories help developers think about the application in its actual context. Often, user stories are written on physical cards and pinned on a board in the workspace. One of the primary motivations for writing user stories is to stimulate conversations between people working on the app.
