# UML

## Learning Objectives

- Students will know that UML diagrams are an industry standard for visually representing the blueprints of a software system
- Students will understand the purpose and syntax of 3 specific UML diagram types, Use Case, Class and Sequence diagrams
- Students will be able to create Use Case, Class and Sequence UML diagrams to model the design of an Electric Scooter Hire system

## Pre-requisites

- Installation of the PlantUML VSCode extension
- An understanding of object-oriented programming

## Lesson

### A litte history

In the 1970s and 80s, Structured Analysis and Design techniques were used to design software. Later, Object-Oriented Anaylsis and Design (OOAD) came about to design Object-oriented (OO) programs. Several techniques emerged but like many computing developments over the years, not having one single standard caused problems. In 1997, a company called Rational Software submitted a proposal titled UML 1.0 to the Object Management Group (yep, abbreviated as OMG). The OMG later took the proposal, added some other elements and went on to standardise UML 1.1 in the same year.

### Common users of UML diagrams

Communicating concepts and ideas in systems development is hard. The UML standard helps to transcend programming languages and different communication techniques. This comes into sharp focus when you consider the different types of employee that may come into contact with the software designs:

- Software Architects (normally create the diagrams)
- Project Managers/Owners
- Business Analysts
- Developers
- Testing/QA team

### Structural modelling vs Behavioural modelling

Structural modelling is how the physical elements of the system fit together. They are the static parts, or the nouns involved in the system. Structural diagrams include:

- Class
- Component
- Package
- Deployment

Behavioural modelling describes the processes and interactions in the system. Whereas structured modelling focuses on the nouns in the system, behavioural modelling focuses on the verbs in the system. Behaviour diagrams include:

- Use case
- Sequence
- State
- Activity diagrams

This might all be sounding very abstract right now, so let's consider a practical example. You're buiding a piece of mapping software, a lot like Google Maps. A physical element of the system could be a map pin. A map pin will have attributes like colour, image, position, etc. We could use structural modelling techniques to model a map pin.

On the other hand, a user will interact with the mapping software, will click on a map pin, read the contents of a dialogue and may close the dialogue. We could model these interactions using behavioural modelling techniques.

### Designing a mapping application

Let's take the example above and develop it further by designing a (very) simple system. The requirements for our system, written as user stories, are as follows:

As a user, I need to:

- Search for a business, so that I can see its location on a map
- Click on the map pin, so that I can see more information about the company
- Click the cross icon, so that I can close the dialogue

We can model the requirements in a use case diagram:

### Class diagrams

- Probably the most common diagram
- Identifies vocab of the system (common language of the team)
- Classes represent nouns
- Describes relationships between the nouns
