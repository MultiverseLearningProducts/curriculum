# Assessment - Journal App

Your task is to create a journal app where users can record their thoughts each day. Your app is targeted at highly security-conscious users and will claim to be the most secure journaling app on the market! The requirements for your app are as follows:

## Functional requirements
* Users are required to sign up and login before using the journal
* Users must be able to create, read, update and delete their own journal entries
* A journal entry must have a date associated with it (e.g. 13 July 2021)
* Users must be able to logout
* The app must include an "About" page which describes how the site protects their data

## Non-functional requirements
* You must produce a sequence diagram illustrating the interactions involved in accessing a secured journal entry
* You are free to choose your own tech stack (we recommend using the same technologies you use at work)
* All code must be stored in Github
* Your API must have associated unit and integration tests
* Your App should have automated end-to-end tests (e.g. using Cypress)
