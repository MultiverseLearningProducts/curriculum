# Summative Project

## Learning Objectives

* Consolidate what you've learned over the course of the module through direct application

## Assignment

You've been commissioned to create a prototype of a note sharing app. The app should allow users to save notes they've written. They should also be able to share notes with specific users.

The stakeholders would like the prototype to be deployed online using a hosting service such as Heroku. The company they represent has been involved in a major security scandal recently involving broken access control; as such, they are extremely concerned about security and have asked that, alongside the software, you create a short report explaining how you've ensured your application is protected against the OWASP Top 10 security vulnerabilities. 

It's likely you will offload some of the work to a library or framework. For example, you might not deal with SQL directly but instead use an ORM such as Sequelize or Entity-Framework. In this case, you should research how these components protect against the relevant security threats (e.g. SQL injection for an ORM, XSS for a front-end framework etc.) and include this in your report.

| NF5 | Must     | The application's UI must be constructed using a component-based approach                           |
| NF6 | Should   | The application should include a set of unit and integration tests (including testing for security) |
| NF7 | Should   | The application should be responsive (e.g. to different screen sizes)                               |

## Extension Assignment

The company shareholders have insisted that the prototype you create is penetration tested. An expert pen-tester (peer in your cohort) will review the documentation you've created and your src code, then attempt to hack into your application.
