# Inclusive Design and Accessibility

## Learning Objectives
* Know what Inclusive Design is
* Give examples of permanent, temporal and situational disabilities
* Explain the benefits of Inclusive Design
* Understand the difference between Inclusive Design and Accessibility
* Apply Inclusive Design to a product design

## Inclusive Design 
Inclusive design is a methodology which includes people with a wide range of different perspectives in the design of a product.

Think about your own abilities and biases:
* gender
* age
* language
* technical literacy
* physical ability
* financial situation
* time available

Imagine if you designed a product solely based on your own abilities and biases, who would you be excluding from using the product?

## Disability
Think about this definition of disability:

> _"Disability ... is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person’s body and features of the society in which he or she lives"_ –World Health Organization

More than 1 billion people around the world live with a disability but all of us have experienced being disabled by our environment either through a:
* Permanent disability (for example, due to a long-term health condition)
* Temporary disability (for example, due to a short-term illness)
* Situational disability (for example, being a dark room)

_Activity 1_: In breakout rooms, write down at least 2 examples of each type of disability and discuss how these could affect the use of a mobile phone. 

_Activity 2_: In breakout rooms, consider how features on Apple's iPhone support these types of disability. Discuss whether these features are specific to this disability or useful to everybody.

## Inclusive Design Sprint: Team Xbox

In an intensive one-week design sprint, the Xbox team came together to reimagine the possibilities of social gaming through the lens of inclusive design.

Listen to their discussions here:

  * Q. What new features did the team come up with?
  * Q. Were these features useful only to deaf gamers or to the wider gaming community?

## Inclusive Products
Take a look at these inclusive objects:

(add picture of traffic lights)
(add picture of Guggenheim)
(add picture of self-driving cars)

* Q. What features do they have to address different types of disability?
* Q. Are these features useful to everybody?
* Q. Can you think of any other inclusively designed products?

_Activity 1_: In breakout rooms your group will be assigned to research more about one of the following inclusive designs: 
* Tommy Hilfiger's adaptive fashion
* IKEA "ThisAbles" furniture
* Nike accessible trainers

Discuss what benefits these companies will gain from these new products and whether the products are useful to everyone regardless of disability.


## Accessibility
In the [Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit Manual](https://download.microsoft.com/download/b/0/d/b0d4bf87-09ce-4417-8f28-d60703d672ed/inclusive_toolkit_manual_final.pdf), accessibility is defined as _"The qualities that make an experience open to all"_.

The result of the inclusive design process is accessible products.

_Web_ Accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the web equally. The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) are governed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and are internationally recognised. 

The WCAG is built around four principle guidelines;
  1. **Perceivable** - information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
  2. **Operable** - users must be able to navigate the content
  3. **Understanding** - content should be presented in clear and simple language
  4. **Robust** - content must be able to be interpreted by a variety of different assistive technologies

Listen to this video introduction to Web Accessibility from the [W3C Web Accesssibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits/) to understand why Web Accessibility is so important. 

![Introduction to Web Accessibility and W3C Standards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20SHvU2PKsM&feature=youtu.be)

The [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-2.html) defines access to content on the Web as a basic human right. 

The UK [Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/made) came into force for public sector bodies on 23 September 2018. Public Sector websites are required by law to meet accessibility standards. 

US Government websites must meet [Section 508 regulations](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies). This requires all electronic and information technology developed, procured, maintained, or used by the federal government must be accessible to people with disabilities. 

Although there is no UK or US law requiring non-government/public sector websites to comply to accessibility standards, it is strongly recommended. Designing for accessibility brings other benefits such as: 
* Improved Site Engine Optimation (SEO) - Google ranks accessible sites higher
* Opportunities to reach more users 
* Enhanced public image for your brand
