# OpenID Connect

## Learning Objectives
* Set up Auth0s universal login
* Recall and follow the 3 stages of design planning (input, processes, outputs)
* Communicate the design of a programme using diagrams

## Lesson

OAuth deals specifically with authorisation of resources, **OpenID Connect** is a protocol which is built on top of OAuth 2.0 and focusses on user authentication. It is widely used to enable user logins on consumer websites and mobile apps.

![sequence diagram showing the OpenID Connect authorization flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/102927348-b8b75700-448e-11eb-9d0d-3d7fa4e6e1ea.png)

OpenID Connect uses an additional JSON Web Token (JWT), called an ID token, to hold basic profile information about the authenticated (logged in) user e.g. their name or email address. Here is an example:

`eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkZyZWQgRmxpbnRzdG9uZSIsImVtYWlsIjoiZnJlZC5mbGludHN0b25lQHdoaXRlaGF0Lm9yZy51ayIsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.DlHfHG2qZXpWszZv-X8LwoQkZUlqVgaXoRmnHXE2y_I`

Use https://jwt.io to find out the name and email hidden in the JWT ID token.

So, instead of passing a user name and password to our Login page and looking this up in our user database, we will delegate authentication to Auth0. This avoid us having to store usernames and passwords (a good thing!) but means that users need to be registered in the Auth0 dashboard. 

## Implementing authentication using Auth0

![Regular Web App Option on Auth0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/105991041-39273400-609b-11eb-9078-6975f7a5e2bc.png)

1. Using the Auth0 Dashboard, create a new application and choose 'Regular Web Applications'
1. Create a totally new express server locally on your machine
1. Follow the wizard and select
    - Node.js(Express)
    - INTEGRATE NOW
    - SAVE SETTINGS AND CONTINUE
    - Add the code to your express project
1. Spin up your server and visit `http://localhost:3000/login`
1. Add `auth_config.json` to your `.gitignore` to avoid details of your Auth0 account being saved to git.

### OpenID connect

This [library](https://npmjs.com/express-openid-connect) creates 3 routes for you on your express server. Be careful not to over write these. They are:

|route|purpose|
|:----|:------|
|`/login`|visit this route to authenticate and create new users (see below)|
|`/logout`|invalidate the logged in users token which will effectively end their 'session'|
|`/callback`|This is the redirect back to your app after successful authentication|
|`/`|This is the "home" route. Logged in users arrive here after being redirected from `/callback`|

You also have a couple of middleware functions from the library to help protect all and individual routes. The library adds a [RequestContext](https://auth0.github.io/express-openid-connect/interfaces/requestcontext.html) object onto the `req` object in express. You can access the logged in user like this `req.oidc.user`. You can view their token like this `req.oidc.accessToken`. Below are two of the main functions in the library to get you going.

|middleware|purpose|
|:---------|:------|
|auth      |this adds `req.oidc` to all your requests|
|requiresAuth|use this to protect routes that require a user to be logged in|

```javascript
app.get('/profile', requiresAuth(), (req, res) => {
  res.send(req.oidc.user)
})

/**
{
    "nickname": "bernard.mordan",
    "name": "bernard.mordan@multiverse.io",
    "picture": "https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/52c5aa1584c1dc479342c603b30ff9e2?s=480&r=pg&d=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Favatars%2Fbe.png",
    "updated_at": "2021-01-27T11:43:17.588Z",
    "email": "bernard.mordan@multiverse.io",
    "email_verified": false,
    "sub": "auth0|601151d59c2f080069ec8597"
}
*/
```

That last property the `sub` is a unique id number for that user. That might be useful...

## Summary

Below is the code to bootstrap a server that will use Auth0 to create, authenticate and manage authorization of users.

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const { sequelize } = require('./models')
const { auth } = require('express-openid-connect')

const openIDconfig = {
    authRequired: false,
    auth0Logout: true,
    secret: 'a long, randomly-generated string stored in env that you make up',
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
    clientID: YOUR_CLIENT_ID,
    issuerBaseURL: 'https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN.eu.auth0.com'
  }

app.use(express.json())
app.use(auth(openIDconfig))

// app.get('/login') this is created by express-openid-connect and displays a login widget
// app.get('/callback') this is created by express-openid-connect and fetches an authenticated user their token
// app.get('/logout') this is created by express-openid-connect and will end a users token based session

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send(req.oidc.user || "No user logged in")
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
    sequelize.sync().then(() => console.log("All ready for banking"))
})
```

## Assignment

Below is a spec for a banking app.

1. Users can log into your app
1. Users can see a balance on their account (due to little time target mobile first)
1. Your app will need to be deployed (heroku)
1. A user should be able to invite a friend via a link in an email (you can integrate with gmail for this)
1. A user should see all their friends listed when they are logged in
1. A user should be able to transfer balance to their friends

In groups come up with a design pitch for this app.

* What will your data model look like?
* How will you trigger an email?
* How will the link in the email work?
* How can you transfer funds from one user to another?
* How can a user add funds?
* What UI do you need to build?

* You will need to set up sequelize and your data models (your data model will be spread over 2 servers! - the user model on Auth0 the rest of the account/transaction model in your SQL database)
* You will need to have a public folder to serve assets out of i.e. `style.css`
* You need to decide on how you will integrate your frontend views (handlebars, pug, vue.js, react)

You will have 2 days to complete this challenge. You can work in groups of 3. You may need to deploy to heroku so your email link will work.
