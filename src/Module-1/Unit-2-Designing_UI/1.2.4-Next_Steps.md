# Next Steps

Now you have a set of designs. You are ready to start the development phase of the software development life cycle and build out your designs.

## Assignment

You will need to learn a frontend framework so you can effectively build user interfaces. In your group you should all decide on the framework you'd like to use. There are lots of things you might need to weight up as a group and your coach can help you all decide if you find it difficult to arrive at a choice.

## Asynchronous work

Learn a frontend frame work *before the next session*. You can use online resources to help you, most frameworks provide tutorials to get you started. Aim to be confident enough to create a Todo list in your chosen frontend framework.
