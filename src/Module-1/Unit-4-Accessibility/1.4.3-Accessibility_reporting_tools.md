## Assignment
  1. Use the `Lighthouse` tool in Chrome Developer Tools to generate a Web Accessibility report for each page in your application.
     * Add your "before" report to a new folder `/accessibility` in the GitHub repo which has your restaurant code
     * How many issues does Lighthouse find?
     * Why could these issues cause issues for users with disabilities?
     * Now edit your HTML to fix these issues
     * Add your "after" report to the `/accessibility` folder

  2. Select to `Emulate vision deficiencies` in the `Rendering` section of Lighthouse. Select each vision deficiency and see whether the user is still able to navigate the site / view content ok

  3. Install the [SiteImprove](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-accessibility/efcfolpjihicnikpmhnmphjhhpiclljc) plugin to Chrome and run a report on each of  the pages in your restaurant app.
    How many issues does SiteImprove find?
    Why could these issues cause issues for users with disabilities?
    Now edit your HTML to fix these issues
  4. Install [Screen Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn) (or use Windows Narrator) and tab through your website. If you were vision impaired, would you understand which restaurant you were viewing or deleting? If not, what could you do to improve site navigation for those using a screen reader.
  5. If you finish early, try checking out the accessibility of other websites too. Try the [ATG Ticket Website](https://atg.nliven.co/tickets/series/wicked?_ga=2.37698784.1776477192.1605217929-908196991.1605217929) with a Vision Deficiency of 'Achromatopsia' - how does it look?
