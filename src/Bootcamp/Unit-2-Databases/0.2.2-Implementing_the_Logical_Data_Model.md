# Implementing the Logical Data Model

## Learning Objectives
* Demonstrate knowledge of unit tests
* Demonstrate knowledge of classes

## Pre-requisites
Familiarity with a [Logical Data Model](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-2-Databases/0.2.1-Logical_Data_Model.html)

## Lesson
Once you have a Logical Data Model you can begin to write a set of tests that will prove your model is sound. TODO - Use the examples from the Airport exercise to implement your data model for your restaurant ordering app.

Once your tests and logic are complete you should run a Jest coverage report to analyse how much of your code is executed during your tests. To do this, add the following line to your package.json file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:report": "jest --coverage=true"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "jest": "^26.4.2"
  }
}
```
Then run `npm run test:report`. You are aiming for 100% test coverage. You should see that Jest generates a 'coverage' report in your project folder under `/coverage/Icov-report/index.html`. Open this in your browser to view coverage by line, branch, function and statement.

The report is interactive hence you can click and drill down into a specific class.

## Assignment
  1. Create a [new Node.js project](/curriculum/Bootcamp/FAQ#createNewProject) for this assignment.
  
  1. Create tests and class definitions for each of the classes in the Restaurant Logical Data Model.
      * Create a Restaurant (with a name, image URL, and a city)
      * Create a Menu and associate it with a Restaurant (the Menu should have a 'title' property and an 'icon' - you can use emojis for icons)
      * Create a Menu Item and associate it with a Menu (Menu Item should have a name and price)

  1. Generate a [test coverage report](/curriculum/Bootcamp/FAQ#generateCoverage)
  1. Commit your code and a screenshot of your coverage report into Github and share the link with your coach for review.
