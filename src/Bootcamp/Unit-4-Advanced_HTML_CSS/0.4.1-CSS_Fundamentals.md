## Lesson

### Understand what CSS is and what it does

CSS is the language we use to style a web page. Whereas HTML provides the means to structure and web page with elements, CSS controls the presentation of the elements. However, it wasn't always this way. In an older version of HTML, you could actually write styles directly into the HTML tags. This made life very tricky for developers, as they didn't have one source of truth when it came to styling. It also meant they had duplicated style definitions. CSS solves this problem by providing the ability to style many elements across different pages using just one set of styles.

### Understand the basic syntax

Below is a simple stylesheet. The syntax starts with an element declaration (e.g body) and then the style properties for that element, enclosed in curly braces.

```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

The important point here is that the styles above will apply to **every** `h1` and `p` found in the HTML. Since there is only ever one body tag, the styles will apply to this tag only.

### Understand inline elements, block elements and inline-block elements

Some elements are **inline** elements and some a **block** level elements. There is also a further display option called **inline-block**. These are all set using the display property.

- Inline elements are elements that group together on the same line. Top/bottom margins are ignored, as are height/width properties.

- Block elements render on their own line. Margins and height/width properties get applied.

- Inline-block elements render on the same line, but behave like a block element.

Common inline elements:

| Element | Function                            |
| :------ | :---------------------------------- |
| a       | Adds a hyperlink                    |
| span    | Applies styles to a selected region |
| img     | Adds an image                       |

Common block level elements

| Element | Function                                             |
| :------ | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| div     | Adds a 'divide' - used to add structure to web pages |
| h1      | Adds a heading 1                                     |
| p       | Adds a paragraph                                     |
| form    | Adds a form                                          |
