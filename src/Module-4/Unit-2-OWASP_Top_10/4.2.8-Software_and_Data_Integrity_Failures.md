## Learning Objectives

* Understand what Software and Data Integrity Failures are
* Understand how to protect against Software and Data Integrity Failures

## Software and Data Integrity Failures

The software we write often relies on software or data we receive from 3rd parties. For example, a web application you write might rely on modules obtained from npm, Nuget or Maven. You may load images and scripts into an HTML page from a CDN. If any of these pieces of data or software are tampered with (i.e. their integrity is compromised) then your application is vulnerable.

## Preventing Integrity Failures

Often data which is sensitive to tampering is given a digital signature or checksum. For example, the Notepad++ online downloads page also contains lists of SHA-256 checksums for each of its versions' binaries.

These hexadecimal digests are the output which you should expect if you hashed your Notepad++ binary with the SHA-256 algorithm. If the binary on your local computer had been tampered with, when you hashed it you would get a different digest. This is one of the reasons why collisions (two inputs hashing to the same output) need to be *hard to find* for cryptographic hashes, since otherwise a hacker could construct their malware in such a way that it produced the same checksum hash as the legitimate version.
