# Server side Validation

## Learning Objective
* Understand the importance of server-side validation to protect against injection attacks

## Pre-requisites
* Lesson [HTML Forms](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-APIs_and_Dynamic_Content/0.3.7_HTML_Forms)

## Lesson
In the [HTML Forms](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-APIs_and_Dynamic_Content/0.3.7_HTML_Forms) lesson we added client side validation to check for the user entering a valid restaurant name and url. However, client side validation can be subverted either by disabling JavaScript in the browser, or, my using a tool such as Postman to call the API directly, bypassing the form.

Listen to this [short video (3mins)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVJ2ukke34s) which explains why this can be a problem. Also think back to Unit 2 when we discussed [SQL injection attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection). 

In this lesson you are going to use [express validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/) to add some server side validation to ensure that a malicious user cannot send in input containing HTML or executable commands or enter a huge amount of text which could break the backend. 

To install `express validator` run:

`npm install express-validator`

Require this in your `server.js` file
```js
const { check, validationResult } = require('express-validator');
```

You can now add validation to your route, for example, to `escape` any HTML characters in the restaurant name field:

```js
app.post('/restaurants', [
    check('name').not().isEmpty().trim().escape()
    ], async (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req)
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() })
    }
```

## Assignment
1. Use the [express validator](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js#validators) documentation to add server-side validation to your route. Include validators for the following:
  * checking that the input for the restaurant name contains only characters which appear in a whitelist
  * ensuring that the restaurant image is a URL
  * ensuring that the restaurant name is less than 40 characters

1. Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review

### Assignment extension tasks
Add additional validators to your route.
