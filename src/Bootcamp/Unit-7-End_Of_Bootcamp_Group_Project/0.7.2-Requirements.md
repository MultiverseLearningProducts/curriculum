# End of Bootcamp Group Project - Requirements

Company X says their sales of sneakers (trainers) are falling in their high street shops. They need a way to increase revenue and reduce the dependence on bricks and mortar stores. A list of all their trainers can be found [in this JSON file](https://api.thesneakerdatabase.com/v1/sneakers?limit=50).
  
There is a need therefore to *build an application to sell sneakers online*.
