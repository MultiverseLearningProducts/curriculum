## Vulnerable Components

Modern software development is more and more becoming about glueing programmes together using 3rd-party libaries and tools. However, an application which relies on a vulnerable library may itself be vulnerable as a consequence.

## Avoiding Vulnerable Components

* Remove unnecessary libaries and components from your codebase/platform
* Regularly scan your dependencies (using a tool like Snyk) to check for anything vulnerabilities that need addressing
* Keep software (operating systems, runtimes, libaries etc.) up-to-date with the latest patches
