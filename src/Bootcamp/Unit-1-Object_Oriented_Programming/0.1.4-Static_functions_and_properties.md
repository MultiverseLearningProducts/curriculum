# Static functions and properties

## Learning Objectives
* Differentiate `static` properties from `instance` properties
* Use `this.constructor` to access static properties
* Argue the case for static properties

## Lesson
In the [Objects in an Airport Domain](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-1-Object_Oriented_Programming/0.1.3-Objects_in_an_Airport_Domain) lesson we created objects from classes using the `new` keyword. For example, we constructed Passenger to board Planes and Bags to assign to Passengers. 

To complete our Airport system we want to be able to move our Planes (and the Passengers they transport) from one Airport to another. 

To do this, we need to be able to access one Airport from another Airport. We can't do this using the properties and functions of an instance of an Airport. For example, if we created London Heathrow (LHR) and Los Angles (LAX) Airports, how could we connect them?

`london.addAirport(LAX)` would be clumsy and hard to keep track of as each new Airport is created.

### Static properties
The `static` keyword defines a static function or property for a class. Static functions and static properties cannot be called on instances of the class, instead, they're called on the class itself. 

We need somewhere we can keep track of all the Airports that we create. Read the code snippet below. Can you see what we are doing?

```javascript
class Airport {
    static airports = []
    
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name
        this.planes = []
        this.constructor.airports.push(this)
    }
    
    land(plane) {
        this.planes.push(plane)
    }
}
```

`Airport.airports` holds an array of all the instances of `Airport` that have been created. Each time we construct an Airport we `push` it into the static array.

## Assignment
TODO - check this explanation

Write a `takeOff` function on an _instance_ of an Airport that does the following:
   * Takes a Plane as an argument
   * Access the static `airports` property
   * Finds that Plane in the outbound Airport's Planes array and removes it
   * Pushes the Plane into the inbound Airport's array of Planes
   * Write tests that prove the above functionality

This will effectively move the Plane object from one Airport to another.
Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review.

## Assignment extensions tasks
Consider when you would use `static` functions.
