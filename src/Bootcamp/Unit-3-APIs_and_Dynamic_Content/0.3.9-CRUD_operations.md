# Create Read Update Destroy (CRUD)

## Learning Objectives
Use the patterns we have learnt so far to enable users to perform create, read, update and destroy operations.

## Pre-requisites
* Lesson [Server side Validation](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-APIs_and_Dynamic_Content/0.3.8_Server_side_Validation)

## Lesson
In our route handler we have all the information we need to create a new restaurant. 

Now let's add functionality to delete a restaurant. We will need to update our template to have a delete button on the restaurant page. For example:

![example of a dynamic href](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/95022824-5dd14900-0671-11eb-9cb3-2d9caa3cbb30.jpg)

On our server we define a new route and use that to perform the delete operation.

```javascript
app.get('/restaurants/:id/delete', async (req, res) => {
    await Restaurant.findByPk(req.params.id)
        .then(restaurant => {
            restaurant.destroy()
            res.redirect('/')
        })
})
```
Powerful! But what if we make a typo and want to update our restaurant? This is more involved. We need to provide the user with the Form they used to create the restaurant, populated with the current values. We then need a new update route to post the new values to.

Let's create a new route that will serve an edit template to the user:

```javascript
app.get('/restaurants/:id/edit', async (req, res) => {
    const restaurant = await Restaurant.findByPk(req.params.id)
    res.render('edit', {restaurant})
})
```
```html
<form action="/restaurants/{{restaurant.id}}/edit" method="POST">
    <div>
        <label>Restaurant name</label>
        <input name="name" value="{{restaurant.name}}" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <label>Restaurant image</label>
        <input name="image" value="{{restaurant.image}}"/>
    </div>
    <button>Update Restaurant</button>
</form>
```
Our edit Form looks similar to the create Form, but we post to a different route. We set the values of the field using the current restaurant values.

Add an edit link to your restaurant page (next to or near the delete button). Now you can use that link to open your edit page.

Finally add the route that will handle the update:

```javascript
app.post('/restaurants/:id/edit', async (req, res) => {
    const restaurant = await Restaurant.findByPk(req.params.id)
    await restaurant.update(req.body)
    res.redirect(`/restaurants/${restaurant.id}`)
})
```
