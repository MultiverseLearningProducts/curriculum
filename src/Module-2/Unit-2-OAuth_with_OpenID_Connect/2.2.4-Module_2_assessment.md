# Assessment - Journal App

Your task is to create a journal app where users can record their thoughts each day. Your app is targeted at highly security-conscious users and will claim to be the most secure journaling app on the market! The requirements for your app are as follows:

## Functional requirements
-   Users must sign-up/login before using the journal
-   Users must be able to create, read, update and delete their own journal entries
-   A journal entry must have a date associated with it (e.g. 13 July 2021)
-   Users must be able to delete their account (along with all their journal entries)??
-   The app must include a "Security" page which describes how the site protects their data

## Non-functional requirements
-   You must produce a sequence diagram illustrating the interactions involved in accessing a secured journal entry
-   You are free to choose your own tech stack (we recommend using the same technologies you use at work)
-   Your API must have associated unit tests ??
-   All code must be stored in Github

### Bonus Points

-   Document your API
-   Deploy your app (e.g. to Heroku)
-   Allow users to login using OpenID Connect
-   Allow users to share a given entry with a given user
-   Create end-to-end tests (e.g. using Cypress)
