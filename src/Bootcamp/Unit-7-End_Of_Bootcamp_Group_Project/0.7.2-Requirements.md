# End of Bootcamp Group Project - Requirements

Company X says their sales of sneakers (trainers) are falling in their high street shops. They need a way to increase revenue and reduce the dependence on bricks and mortar stores. A list of all their trainers can be found by calling this api - https://thesneakerdatabase.com/api.
  
There is a need therefore to *build a website to sell sneakers online*.
