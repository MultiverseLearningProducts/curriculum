# Continuous Integration & Deployment

You have implemented the testing pyramid! In the software development life cycle development phase is followed by testing and after testing comes deployment. Now as a senior engineer responsible for a product or service you'll want developers to run those tests every time they make changes and definitely run them before deploying those changes. How could you be sure that happened?

You could ask nicely. Might be a better option is to systematize the running of tests so it becomes impossible to deploy without the tests being run on your codebase. Then you can deploy with greater confidence. In this session we are going to look at an industry wide practice of building integrated deployment pipelines.

## Pipelines

A continuous integration (CI) automates the process of deploying software. Often the pipeline connects to version control, and will automate a deployment when code is pushed to the master branch. That deployment usually includes a number of stages, for example, building the app, testing it, updating version numbers etc and finally deploying it.

In this diagram of a pipeline you can see git 3 github repos. A mobile app and a backend service. All 3 repos when they are pushed to will trigger a series of automated stages including the "System_Tests" stage. If the tests pass, then the code is deployed into a production environment.

## Building your own pipeline

You should have a project from our last session with each type of test in it. Our mission is to create a pipeline that will connect to our github, pull the new code from the repo, run the tests and deploy it to Heroku.

### Version control

If your project is not in version control put it into version control.

### The Unit tests

Have your project set up in such a way that you can run the unit tests with a single command. For example:
```sh
npm run test:unit
```
