## Ratings 

## Learning Objectives
* Extend your data model to include a star rating for each restaurant. 


## Pre-requisites
* Lesson [Full CRUD operations](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-APIs_and_Dynamic_Content/0.3.10_Full_CRUD_operations)

## Lesson
Customers of each restaurant are able to rate their visit to a restaurant. 

This means we need to extend our data model to include a `Rating` class/table which is associated to the `Restaurant` table as follows:
```js
Restaurant.hasMany(Rating, {as: 'ratings', foreignKey: 'restaurant_id'})
Rating.belongsTo(Restaurant, {foreignKey: 'restaurant_id'})
```

A Rating will consist of a 'number of stars', from 0-5.
> ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ 

> ★ ★ ★ ★ ★

To display the overall rating you will need to `findAll` the ratings associated to a restaurant and then calculate the average, displaying this as a star (or other) icon on the screen.

## Assignment
1. Add a ratings system for the restaurant model. Get ideas from sites like [Trip Advisor](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/) or [Trust Pilot](https://uk.trustpilot.com/).

* The restaurant should display the average rating out of 5 stars from all the ratings that have been awarded to it.
* On a restaurant page you should be able to add a rating.
* Ratings need to be displayed on the restaurant page, and the card.

1. Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review

### Assignment extension tasks
Extend the rating functionality by allowing review comments to be added alongside the star rating.
