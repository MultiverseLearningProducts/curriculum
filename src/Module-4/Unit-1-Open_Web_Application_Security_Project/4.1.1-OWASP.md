## OWASP

> The Open Web Application Security ProjectÂ® (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software.

Their website https://owasp.org/ is a great resource for information on software security. 

## OWASP Top 10

Periodically, OWASP produces a [list](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) of what it considers the 10 most important classes of software vulnerabilities that exist in the world. The vulnerabilities are ranked based on their prevalence and their severity. Along with a description of each vulnerability, OWASP also includes some examples and strategies for mitigating against them. At the time of writing (2022), the current top 10 is:

1) Broken Access Control
2) Cryptographic Failures
3) Injection
4) Insecure Design
5) Security Misconfiguration
6) Vulnerable and Outdated components
7) Identification and Authentication Failures
8) Software and Data Integrity Failures 
9) Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10) Server-Side Request Forgery
