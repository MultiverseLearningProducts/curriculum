# Prototyping UI

The input to the design phase of the software development life cycle is requirements. There are 2 types of requirements, functional and non-functional. Both need to be considered in this phase of the SDLC, as the output to this stage is designs that can be implemented. The main concern at this point is finding the best way to deliver the functional and non-functional requirements, that also accommodates the constrains of time, budget, team capacity etc. You will have your own requirements for your group project at this stage. Below I'm going to walk through some example requirements to demonstrate a typical work flow from requirement to final design.

## Requirements

### Functional
|Id|Priority|Description|
|--|:----:|-----------|
|F1|MUST|Apprentices need to record their off the job training (OTJ) hours|
|F2|MUST|Apprentices need to record the OTJ Date|
|F3|MUST|Apprentices need to declare the activity took place during work hours|
|F4|MUST|Apprentices need to select a category for the activity they are recording|
|F5|MUST|Apprentices need to describe the activity in words|
|F6|BONUS|Apprentices can access and use default values|

### Non-functional
|Id|Priority|Description|
|---|:----:|-----------|
|NF1|MUST|Apprentices need to record their off the job training easily|
|NF2|BONUS|Apprentices should be motivated to update their OJT|
|NF3|BONUS|Apprentices can complete their OJT quickly|

## Start the design process

The place to start is asking the question of yourself...
> What are the inputs to this UI component?
* A date
* A number of hours
* A category from a list
* A boolean declaration
* A short piece of text
> What are the outputs of this UI component?
* Updated OJT total
* The categories that you can choose from
* The textual input
* The status of the declaration

Once you have the inputs and outputs you can think about the human computer interaction (HCI) and the 10 heuristics. For example if we need to collect a date, which of the 10 heuristics should we consider? _Consistency and Standards?_ Could we consider _Systems and Status_. Presenting a date input field that was populated with today's date might be a good start? Are their constraints that would help the users? Guide rails; like not picking a date in the future.

You can start to experiment with possible arrangements of the different input fields. One of the non-functional requirements is this data should be quick and easy to collect. So I'm thinking maybe the "submit" action is also the declaration that this activity was performed in work hours?

## Free hand sketches

Start in a lose way sketching out different options. Keep referring back to the 10 heuristics. Try lots of different ideas.

From this jam session I like the twisting clock idea, like you'd twist an egg timer to collect a time in hours, but its a bit unusual interaction and people may not know how to use it. I like the chatbot style interaction where the OJT widget is a series of questions. The apprentice only needs to think about 1 thing at a time.

I think this exemplifies the heuristic of _Aesthetic and Minimalist Design_ Interfaces should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Some how I think just answering 1 question looks less time consuming than seeing all the inputs all at once. I would also need to show progress through the questions so I'm communicating _Visibility of System Status_ in my design.

## Wireframes

I might develop this idea a bit further. In my next prototype I am getting more interested in the details of the interface. What buttons do I need? Where will they go? How will I communicate _Visibility of System Status_? At this stage I am not concerned with look and feel. I just want to block out the controls and components.

Now you can turn to your prototyping tool of choice. I have done these on "Sketch" for the Mac.

I learn a few things from putting this together. With the slider for hours I might just flash up on the screen the current hour that is selected.
