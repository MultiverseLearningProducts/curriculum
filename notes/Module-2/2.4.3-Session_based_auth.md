|Mandy|17/05/21|Basic Auth does not have the concept of a logout - you have to exit the browser to logout. Give REST APIS should be stateless, I am not sure this lesson is necessary. It can get quite complicated implementing sessions in Spring (https://www.javainuse.com/spring/springboot_session). I think we should just jump straight into OAuth as feedback from apprentices was they wanted more time on the Banking App and working with OAuth. See https://restfulapi.net/statelessness.  |
