# Object Relational Mapping - part 1

## Learning Objectives
* Implement an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) design pattern

## Pre-requisites
Familiarity with [Database access using Node.js](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-2-Databases/0.2.5-Database_access_using_Node.html)

## Lesson
We represent objects in our programs with classes and in the database as rows. We can't store an instance of a class in the row of a database. We can't easily use the row of a database in our programs. 

The ORM pattern is about abstracting away the database layer. It allows us to focus on creating / manipulating instances of classes such as Restaurant and delegate the work of mapping them to database fields to the ORM layer. 

In this lesson we will manually persist Restaurant, Menu and Menu Item data as part of the class constructor. This is not a recommended approach for production (a commercial ORM system is preferred) however it will allow us to illustrate the ORM concepts. 

In both our tests and our main program we have to make sure the database is set up with the tables we need to store our Restaurants in. We recommend creating a file that initialises the database appropriately for test or production use and exports it.

```javascript
// db.js
const {Database} = require('sqlite3')
const location = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test' ? ':memory:' : './db.sqlite'
module.exports = new Database(location)
```
In the example above if we are running tests, the value of `process.env.NODE_ENV` will be 'test', so when our tests are running we always start with an empty, in-memory database. When we come to just run this code in 'development' or 'production' we specify a file that holds our data.

We should always start with a failing test and practise 'Test Driven Development' (TTD). Our test needs to ensure that when we create a new Restaurant it is saved to the database. However, our classes assume that the database is ready to read and write to so we can use the `beforeAll` function that Jest provides to create the required tables <em>before</em> our tests run. 

```javascript
const Restaurant = require('./Restaurant')
const db = require('./db.js')

describe('Restaurants', () => {
    beforeAll((done) => {
        db.run('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS restaurants(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, image TEXT);', done)
    })

    test('When a Restaurant is created it is stored in the database', async (done) => {
        const restaurant = await new Restaurant({name: 'Boo Jangles', image: 'https://some.image.url'})
        expect(restaurant.id).toBe(1)
        db.get('SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE id=?;', 1, (err, row) => {
            expect(row.name).toBe('Boo Jangles')
            done()
        })
    })
})
```
We also want to test that we can create a new instance of a Restaurant from a row.
```javascript
test('can create an instance of an restaurant from a row', (done) => {
    db.get('SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE id=?', 1, async (err, row) => {
        const restaurant = await new Restaurant(row)
        expect(restaurant.id).toBe(1)
        expect(restaurant.name).toBe('Boo Jangles')
        db.get('SELECT COUNT(id) AS total FROM restaurants;', (err, count) => {
            expect(count.total).toBe(1)
            done()
        })
    })        
})
```

## Assignment
   1. Create JavaScript code to represent the 3 classes below. There is no need at this stage to worry about relationships between classes. ![UML Class Diagram showing Restaurant, Menu and MenuItem classes and attributes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/111300668-3ed7d980-8649-11eb-99b2-5a842259c4ed.png)
   
   2. Write code to persist an instance of each class to the database. 
   3. Write code to create an instance of each class from a database row. 
   4. Ensure that the unit tests described above run successfully.
   5. Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review.

## Assignment extension tasks
* Add additional tests to simulate error conditions
