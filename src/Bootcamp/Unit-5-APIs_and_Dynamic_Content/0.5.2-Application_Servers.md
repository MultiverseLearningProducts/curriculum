# Application Servers

## Learning Objectives
* Build an application server serving dynamic content using [Node.js Express](https://expressjs.com/)  
* Understand the difference between static and dynamic content
* Create dynamic content using the Handlebars templating framework

## Pre-requisites

## Lesson
Static content is usually read from disc, it is the <em>same</em> on every request and for every user e.g. HTML, CSS and image files. 

Dynamic content is content that can <em>change</em> from request to request, and might be different for different people. For example, everyone has the same basic Twitter page, but each person's page is filled with content that is particular to them. What is shared between users is the page's template. The content is changeable or dynamic.

So where does the dynamic content come from? Dynamic content is usually stored in a database or comes from another service. The server responds to a request by fetching user specific content, applying business logic and returning a response as either HTML or in a data format such as JSON. The content for the resulting web page is built per request, 'on-the-fly'.

If we are serving dynamic content, our server is now called an 'application server'.

### Creating a Route
The way we intercept or 'handle' HTTP requests is by declaring an Express 'route' in our `server.js` file. Routes determine how an application’s endpoints (URLs) respond to client requests.

Here is an example route which returns the current date when the user navigates to the root endpoint e.g. http://localhost:3000.

```javascript
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
    const date = new Date()
    response.send(date)})
```

**Important** - Make sure you remove the `public/index.html` file to avoid it interfering with your `/` route.

### Creating a Template
Imagine we are going to build a Restaurant application like Deliveroo or Uber Eats. Our dynamic content is going to be driven by a restaurant data model. We want to display a list of restaurants within a web page. To do this, we are going to use a templating framework called [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/). This is a well supported template library in which you write HTML and use placeholders for dynamic content. 

A Handlebars expression is content surrounded by `{{` `}}`. When the template is executed, the expression is replaced with values from an input object. 

> Can you guess why the framework might be called Handlebars?!

Handlebars expects a specific folder structure:
```sh

views
├── restaurants.handlebars
└── layouts
    └── main.handlebars

```
The `views` folder contains Handlebars templates which get rendered into `layouts`. 

A `layout` is an HTML page with a `{{{body}}}` placeholder into which views are rendered. The `layouts` folder typically holds a default `main.handlebars` layout. 

For our restaurant website we will set the `main.handlebars` layout as follows: 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        {{{body}}}
    </body>
</html>
```
The `restaurants.handlebars` file will be rendered in the `main.handlebars` layout and, for now, will simply print out the date. 
```html
<h1>Restaurants</h1>
<small>{{date}}</small>
```

We install Handlebars by running 
> `npm install handlebars express-handlebars @handlebars/allow-prototype-access`

Once installed, we can `require` it and set it as the templating engine to use in our Express code. 

```javascript
const Handlebars = require('handlebars')
const expressHandlebars = require('express-handlebars')
const {allowInsecurePrototypeAccess} = require('@handlebars/allow-prototype-access')

// setup our templating engine
const handlebars = expressHandlebars({
    handlebars: allowInsecurePrototypeAccess(Handlebars)
})
app.engine('handlebars', handlebars)
app.set('view engine', 'handlebars')
```

We can then modify our route to pass the dynamic date object into our Handlebars template and return the resulting HTML.

```js
// this route matches any GET request to the root URL
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
    response.render('restaurants', {date: new Date()})
})
```
The first argument to `response.render` is the name of the view template we want to render. In this example, this refers to a file named `restaurants.handlebars`.
The second argument to `response.render` is the dynamic data which will be passed to the view template.

## Assignment
  1. Install Handlebars as a Node dependency in your existing project

  1. Modify your `server.js` file to serve both static and dynamic content as per the code above. Start your server by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the date displayed. Use 'Chrome Developer Tools' to see the HTTP requests as you refresh the page. 

  1. Create another template in the `views` folder for an `about.handlebars` page. Add some static text for the page and a placeholder for a string holding the name of the website author.

  1. Create another route handler on your server, `/about`. When the user navigates to this URL, the Express route should render the `about.handlebars` page and pass in your name as the website author.

  1. Add a link from the `restaurants` page to the `about` page

  1. Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review
