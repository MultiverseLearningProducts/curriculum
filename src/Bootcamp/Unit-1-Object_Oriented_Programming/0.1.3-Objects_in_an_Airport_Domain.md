# Objects in an Airport Domain

## Learning Objectives
* Recognise how classes are represented in code
* Locate particular properties in a deeply nested set of objects
* Create and execute a suite of unit tests

## Pre-requisites
* Familiarity with [Test Driven Development](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-1-Object_Oriented_Programming/0.1.2-Test_Driven_Development)
* Familiarity with [JavaScript Objects and Functions](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-1-Object_Oriented_Programming/0.1.1-JavaScript_Objects_And_Functions)

## Lesson
In this lesson are going to implement our Airport system. This exercise is designed to introduce you to the idea of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Objected-Oriented Programming languages use objects as the fundamental unit of coding, such languages include C++, Java, TypeScript, Python and Scala. JavaScript is not a pure Object-Oriented Programming language however it does have support for classes.

Note that JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don't have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. Other languages such as Java are strongly typed, requiring all variables to declare their types. TypeScript layers strong static typing onto JavaScript as well as supporting encapsulation via `private` properties.

### Objects and Classes
Our Airport system is going to have the following classes in it:

1. Bag
2. Passenger
3. Plane
4. Airport

What does a Bag have? A weight. It also has a relationship to a Person (or in Airport terms, a Passenger) who takes a Bag on holiday. One of the important things to think about in OOP is which object is responsible for what properties or behaviours. In our Airport system there are going to be many Bags. In our code we could create each Bag like this:

```javascript
const bag = {weight: 16}
```

however, someone might come along and make a Bag like this instead:

```javascript
const bag = {kg: 16}
```

We therefore want to standardise our Bag construction. Why do you think we might want to do that? 

What we want is a way to create Bags that all follow the same template. Like a rubber stamp, stamping out the same graphic each time.

The way to make yourself a 'rubber object stamper' is to create a class and use the `new` keyword to instantiate instances of your class. In other words you use the `Bag` class to make Bag objects in your program.

```javascript
class Bag {
    
    constructor(weight) {
        this.weight = weight
    }
}

const bag = new Bag(16)
console.log(bag.weight) // 16
```
In the code example above we declare a class using the `class` keyword. The name of the class should be capitalised and singular. 

After the class name comes the block that contains the class definition. When we create a new Bag we want it to have a weight, hence we declare a 'constructor' function which will be called with zero or more arguments when we use the `new` keyword. 

Can you see how we add a property `weight` to the `this` object? `this` refers to the instance of the class that we just created.

### TDD for Bags

How would you write a unit test for this Bag class?

If we try to create a Bag without a weight - the constructor should throw an Error. This protects our program from trying to do calculations on `bag.weight` and reading `undefined` as the value. 

Why might the weight be undefined?

Our failing test will include this assertion:
```javascript
expect(() => new Bag()).toThrowError('bag must have a weight')
```

Notice how we have to run a function inside `expect` to trigger the error and catch it. If we just wrote the following:

```javascript
expect(new Bag()).toThrowError('bag must have a weight')
```

it would be like calling expect with `Error` and then expecting the Error to throw (which it won't, it's too late, the trap has been sprung). We'll need to update our Bag class to throw an Error if no weight is passed into the constructor. We throw an Error using this syntax:

```javascript
throw new Error('some error message in here')
```

Can you spot the `new` keyword above? What do you think that is doing in the Error class definition?

### Bags belong to a Passenger

Our Airport system has Bags. We also need to create Passengers. Let's make a Passenger class with the following properties:

  * A name
  * Bags

People often fly with a more than one Bag. Our Passengers should be able to carry multiple Bags. What data structure would work well here?

To add a Bag to a Passenger we should be able to call a function on the instance of a Passenger. Read the code below:

```javascript
const bob = new Passenger('Bob the Builder')
const bobsCabinBag = new Bag(9)
const bobsHullBag = new Bag(23)
bob.addBag(bobsCabinBag)
bob.addBag(bobsHullBag)
console.log(bob.bags) // [ Bag { weight: 9 }, Bag { weight: 23 } ]
```
The way to define a function on a class is like this:
```javascript
class Passenger {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name
        this.bags = []
    }

    addBag(bag) {
        this.bags.push(bag)
    }
}

module.exports = Passenger
```

## Assignment
  1. Create a [new Node.js project](/curriculum#createNewProject) for this assignment.

  1. Use TDD to create unit tests for the Bag and Passenger classes. These tests will fail initially as the classes won't exist. _Follow [these instructions for running your tests](/curriculum#runJestTests)._

  1. Implement the Bag and Passenger classes. Make sure the unit tests pass.

  1. Now we have Passengers with Bags, they are ready to board their flight! Use TDD to create unit tests for the Plane and Airport classes. Include tests for:
     * reading the weight of a Bag belonging to a specific Passenger on a specific Plane at a specific Airport
     * creating multiple Airports and Planes
     * landing Planes at Airports _i.e airport.land(plane)_
     * boarding Passengers onto a Plane
     * give a plane an inbound property (the name of the airport it is currently landed in)
     * give a plane a destination property so you can set where it will fly too

  1. Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review

## Assignment extension task
  1. Take a copy of your solution and covert it to use TypeScript. What differences do you notice? Note that the TypeScript files must use `export = NameOfClass;` rather than `module.exports`. 
  1. Document your classes using the [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) comment structure and generate the HTML documentation. Why do you think this documentation could be useful?
  1. Commit your Typescript solution and generated HTML to your Git repository.
