## Lesson

### Understand inline elements, block elements and inline-block elements

Some elements are _inline_ elements and some a _block_ level elements. There is also a further display option called _inline-block_. These are all set using the display property.

```css
.block-anchor {
  display: block;
}
```

- Inline elements are elements that group together on the same line. Top/bottom margins are ignored, as are height/width properties. Examples include: anchors, span and img.

- Block elements render on their own line. Margins and height/width properties are applied. Examples include: div, h1, p and form.

- Inline-block elements render on the same line, but behave like a block element.
