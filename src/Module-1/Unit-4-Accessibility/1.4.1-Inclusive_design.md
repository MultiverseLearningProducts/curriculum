# Inclusive Design

## Learning Objectives
* Know what Inclusive Design is
* Give examples of permanent, temporal and situational disabilities
* Explain the benefits of Inclusive Design
* Apply Inclusive Design to a product design

## Inclusive Design 
Inclusive design is a methodology which includes people with a wide range of different perspectives in the design of a product.

Think about your own abilities and biases:
* gender
* age
* language
* technical literacy
* physical ability
* financial situation
* time available

Imagine if you designed a product solely based on your own abilities and biases, who would you be excluding from using the product?

## Disability
Think about this definition of disability:

> _"Disability ... is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person’s body and features of the society in which he or she lives"_ –World Health Organization

More than 1 billion people around the world live with a disability but all of us have experienced being disabled by our environment either through a:
* Permanent disability (for example, due to a long-term health condition)
* Temporary disability (for example, due to a short-term illness)
* Situational disability (for example, being a dark room)

_Activity 1_: In breakout rooms, write down at least 2 examples of each type of disability and discuss how these could affect the use of a mobile phone. 

_Activity 2_: In breakout rooms, consider how features on Apple's iPhone support these types of disability. Discuss whether these features are specific to this disability or useful to everybody.

## Inclusive Design Sprint: Team Xbox

In an intensive one-week design sprint, the Xbox team came together to re-imagine the possibilities of social gaming through the lens of inclusive design.

Listen to their discussions here:

  * Q. What new features did the team come up with?
  * Q. Were these features useful only to deaf gamers or to the wider gaming community?

## Inclusive Products
Take a look at these inclusively designed products/buildings:

* Q. What features do they have to address different types of disability?
* Q. Are these features useful to everybody?
* Q. Can you think of any other inclusively designed products?

_Activity_: In breakout rooms your group will be asked to research one of the following inclusive designs: 
* Tommy Hillfiger's adaptive fashion
* IKEA "ThisAbles" furniture
* Nike accessible trainers
* Lego braille bricks

Discuss what benefits these companies will gain from these new products and whether the products are useful to everyone regardless of disability.

## Assignment
Your Customer has added new requirements to your next Agile sprint. They require you to ensure the product is fully inclusive.

Review the Personas you created previously. Add new Personas for individuals with permanent, temporaral and situational disabilities (3 in total). Discuss with your team how you can modify your design to meet the diverse needs of these and other users.
