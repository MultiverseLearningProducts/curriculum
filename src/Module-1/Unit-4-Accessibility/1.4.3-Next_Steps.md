## Assignment

Modifying your design & code to support the 3 personas and make the website accessible. Generate a lighthouse report *before* and *after* so you can demonstrate the improvements to your site with data.

## Asynchronous work

Work together to plan a sprint between now and the next session to make your changes. You will have to create and assign tasks, and keep communicating with each other as you'll all be back in your places of work during your sprint.
