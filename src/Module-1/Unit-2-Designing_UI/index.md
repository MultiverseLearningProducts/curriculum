# Unit 2
## Designing UI

In this Unit you are going to learn a set of principles to guide you in the creating user interfaces or UI. These higher level principles we want you to then apply using tools which we will also introduce to you over the course of this Unit. Once you have studied this section you'll be able to design and prototype UI designs for components or more extensive page layouts.

## Outcomes

We'd like you to take one of the business problems from Unit 2 and be confident and able to wire-framing and then create mock ups of UI that you can then implement in Unit 3.
