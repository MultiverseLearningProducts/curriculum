# Next Steps

Having completed the previous assignments, it is now time to put it all together and create a document which sets out the plan for your MVP. Remember, you're only tasked with creating the frontend for your given business oppurtunity.

## Assignment

In your groups, you will capture your MVP. Create a document which includes all your work from the previous exercises. Do your best to make this document as clear as possible - imagine that, if you were to swap documents with another group - they would know exactly what you were planning to execute.

Share this document with your coach at the end of the lesson.

## Asynchronous work

The next module will involve creating wireframes of your UI. As such, your task to complete *before the next workshop* is to learn a prototyping tool and create a wireframe mockup of one of your favourite website's pages. For example, you could learn Figma and use it to create a wireframe your Netflix homepage. You will need to bring this mockup to the next session to share with the class.
