# HTML Form and Lists

> Every application I work on just seems to be a load of forms and lists.

Its time to start a conversation with our application. At the moment we have implemented data flowing in one direction; from the datastore to the browser. Now we need to create that journey in the opposite direction; from the user to the datastore.

We are going to do this in 3 steps:

1. First of all we need to collect all the data we need to create a new resource (restaurant) from our user.
1. Secondly we are going to sent that data to our server
1. Finally if we create the resource ok we need to indicate to the user that our operation has worked and they have been successful; if it didn't work we need to communicate that to our user and advise about what they can do next.

## User input

HTML provides a comprehensive set of elements we can use for data collection.

|Input Type|Data Type|Example|
|:--|:--|:---:|
|text|String|<input type="text"/>|
|number|Number|<input type="number"/>|
|Select (Dropdown)|Emun|<select><option>North</option><option>South</option><option>East</option><option>West</option></select>|
|radio|1 from a list|<input name="radio" type="radio" value="N"><label>North</label></input><input name="radio" type="radio" value="S"><label>South</label></input><input name="radio" type="radio" value="E"><label>East</label></input><input name="radio" type="radio" value="W"><label>West</label></input>|
|checkbox|Many from a list|<input name="radio" type="checkbox" value="N"><label>North</label></input><input name="radio" type="checkbox" value="S"><label>South</label></input><input name="radio" type="checkbox" value="E"><label>East</label></input><input name="radio" type="checkbox" value="W"><label>West</label></input>|
|time|DateTime|<input type="time"/>|
|email|Valid Email|<input type="email"/>|
|tel|Valid Telephone Number|<input type="tel"/>|
|url|Valid URL|<input type="url"/>|
|search|String|<input type="search"/>|
|password|String (masked)|<input type="password"/>|
|range|Number|<input type="range"/>|
|color|HEX code|<input type="color"/>|
|file|file path|<input type="file"/>|

Paragraph text.

<textarea style="width:75%"></textarea>

Input elements are enclosed within a `<form>` element. The form element captures the data from all the different input fields it contains and will enable us to intercept and process our inputs before sending them to the server.

### Create the form element

```html
<form id="create-restaurant" onsubmit="processForm(this);return false;">
    <div>
        <label for="restaurant-name">Name of restaurant</label>
        <input id="restaurant-name" name="name" required/>
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="restaurant-image">Upload a hero image</label>
        <input id="restaurant-image" name="image" type="file" accept="image/*" required/>
    </div>
    <div>
        <button>Create</button>
    </div>
</form>
```
The javascript in the `onsubmit` handler is calling a function that is defined below. By returning `false`, we prevent the submit triggered by a `<button>` element within a `<form>` element from reloading the page. The `this` passed to `processForm` is the form element itself. We can send this data off to our endpoint.
```javascript
function processForm(form) {
    fetch('http://localhost:3000/restaurants', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: new FormData(form)
    })
    .then(console.info)
    .catch(console.error)
}
```
### Update the server
We are dealing with 'Multipart' form data. The form has multiple parts, the text field with the name of the restaurant, the file meta data, and the binary content of the image file. This is best processed on the server using a middleware called `multer`. You will need to update your server code to handle the images that it receives storing the file on disc, and the URL to that file in the new restaurant record in your database. Below is an example of how to set up the `multer` middleware to make processing your image uploads easier.
```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const path = require('path')
const multer = require('multer')
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: (req, fileData, next) => {
        next(null, path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'uploads'))
    },
    filename: (req, fileData, next) => {
        // in this function you can name the file however you like
        next(null, new Date().getTime() + path.extname(fileData.originalname))
    }
})
const images = multer({ storage })

app.post('/restaurants', images.single('image'), (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body) // here you can access the text field name of the restaurant req.body.name 
    console.log(req.file) // this object is the meta data you need to store/process
    // the uploaded file will be in your `public/uploads` folder (go look!)
    res.sendStatus(201) // 201 is the response code for successfully creating a resource
})
```
Now you will have a URL for an image that you can display in your UI with your restaurant in `req.file.path` and you can access the name of the restaurant in `req.body.name`.
