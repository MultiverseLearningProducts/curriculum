# Summative Project

## Learning Objectives

* Consolidate what you've learned over the course of the module through direct application

## Assignment

You've been commissioned to create a prototype of a note sharing app. The app should allow users to save notes they've written. They should also be able to share notes with specific users.

The stakeholders would like the prototype to be deployed online using a hosting service such as Heroku. The company they represent has been involved in a major security scandal recently involving broken access control; as such, they are extremely concerned about security and have asked that, alongside the software, you create a short report explaining how you've ensured your application is protected against the OWASP Top 10 security vulnerabilities.

| NF2 | Must     | The steps taken to protect against the OWASP Top 10 must be included in a separate document         |
| NF3 | Must     | The application must be accessible online (i.e. be deployed)                                        |
| NF4 | Must     | The application must meet modern accessability standards                                            |
| NF5 | Should   | The application should include a set of unit and integration tests (including testing for security) |

## Extension Assignment

The company shareholders have insisted that the prototype you create is penetration tested. An expert pen-tester (peer in your cohort) will review the documentation you've created and your src code, then attempt to hack into your application.
