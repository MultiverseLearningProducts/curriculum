## Lesson
The Web is an essential part of every day life. Web Accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the web equally. At least 1 in 5 people in the UK have a long term illness, impairment or disability; many more have a temporary disability.

The [standards for Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) are governed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and are internationally recognised.

The [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-2.html) defines access to content on the Web as a basic human right. The UK [Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/made) came into force for public sector bodies on 23 September 2018. Public Sector websites are required by law to meet accessibility standards.

Listen to this video introduction to Web Accessibility from the [W3C Web Accesssibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits/) to understand why Web Accessibility is so important. Enable Closed Captions using the CC option in You Tube if you require it.

The WCAG is built around four principle guidelines;
  1. **Perceivable** - information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
  2. **Operable** - users must be able to navigate the content
  3. **Understanding** - content should be presented in clear and simple language
  4. **Robust** - content must be able to be interpreted by a variety of different assistive technologies

Web Accessibility is essential for many but useful for everyone.

## Assignment
  1. Use the `Lighthouse` tool in Chrome Developer Tools to generate a Web Accessibility report for all the pages in your restaurant application.
     * Add your "before" report to a new folder `/accessibility` in the GitHub repo which has your restaurant code
     * How many issues does Lighthouse find?
     * Why could these issues cause issues for users with disabilities?
     * Now edit your HTML to fix these issues
     * Add your "after" report to the `/accessibility` folder

  2. Select to `Emulate vision deficiencies` in the `Rendering` section of Lighthouse. Select each vision deficiency and see whether the user is still able to navigate the site / view content ok

  3. Install the [SiteImprove](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-accessibility/efcfolpjihicnikpmhnmphjhhpiclljc) plugin to Chrome and run a report on each of  the pages in your restaurant app.
    How many issues does SiteImprove find?
    Why could these issues cause issues for users with disabilities?
    Now edit your HTML to fix these issues
  4. Install [Screen Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn) (or use Windows Narrator) and tab through your website. If you were vision impaired, would you understand which restaurant you were viewing or deleting? If not, what could you do to improve site navigation for those using a screen reader.

## Assignment extension tasks
Try checking out the accessibility of other websites too. Try the [ATG Ticket Website](https://atg.nliven.co/tickets/series/wicked?_ga=2.37698784.1776477192.1605217929-908196991.1605217929) with a Vision Deficiency of 'Achromatopsia' - how does it look?
