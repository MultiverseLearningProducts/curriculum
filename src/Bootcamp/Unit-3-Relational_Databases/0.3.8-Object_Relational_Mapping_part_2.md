# Object Relational Mapping - part 2

## Learning Objectives
* Implement an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) design pattern with relationships between classes

## Pre-requisites
[Object Relational Mapping - part 1](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-Relational_Databases/0.3.7-Object_Relational_Mapping_part_1.html)

## Lesson
There is an important dimension missing from our 'home grown' ORM implementation - relationships. As we see from the class diagram below, our Restaurants have Menus and our Menus have Menu Items. 
![UML Class Diagram showing relationships between Restaurant, Menu and MenuItem classes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/105141638-5d11d500-5af1-11eb-98ee-d177df9c5894.png)

We want to be able to access our Menus like this:

```javascript
restaurant.menus // [Menu, Menu]
```
and from each Menu we want to be able to access the list of items on the Menu:
```javascript
menu.items // [Item, Item]
```
We therefore need to expand our Restaurant class to include a function that will create and add a Menu instance to the Restaurant. 

```javascript
async addMenu(title) {
    const menu = await new Menu({title, restaurant_id: this.id})
    this.menus.push(menu)
}
```
Then we need to get the Menu Items for a Menu, and the Menus for a Restaurant. So when we instantiate a Restaurant with a row from the database (the Restaurant is stored with an id), we will also need to retrieve all the Menus. That way a new instance of a Restaurant has all it's Menus in place, and each of those Menus have their Menu Items in place. We expect to be able to drill down through all our connected data like this:
```javascript
restaurant.menus[0].items[0].price // 12.50
```

## Assignment

* Enhance the solution from the [Object Relational Mapping - Part 1](https://multiverselearningproducts.github.io/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-Relational_Databases/0.3.7-Object_Relational_Mapping_part_1.html) lesson to include the relationships between your Restaurant and Menu classes and the Menu and Menu Item classes as described above.
* Ensure you have unit tests that cover the new functionality.
* Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review.
