## Learning Objectives

* Consolidate your understanding of software vulnerabilities and their affect on industry

## Assignment

There are KSBs in the IFATE L4 Software Developer standard which relate directly to security:

Using the concepts you've learned over this module, see if you can add some security-related content to your portfolio. For example, if you've done some work with database, you might want to explain how you've ensured the code you've written is safe from injection attacks.
