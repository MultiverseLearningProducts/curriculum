# Responsive CSS Background Images

## Pre-requisites

## Lesson
**TODO - THIS LESSON IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!**

In our restaurant application we want to display an restaurant image in each 'card' in our layout. The issue we face is that different restaurant images are different sizes, yet we want them all to fit in our card nicely regardless. The trick that lots of developers use to accomplish this is to use the `background-image` property. Setting an image as a background image in CSS gives us flexible sizing and cropping capabilities. This is very useful when our content is dynamic and we have images of varying sizes to deal with. 

By setting the `background-size` property, background images will also respond to resizing, meaning they will xxxx


TODO - remove Handlebars specific content from below..

To update your card to display the background image of your restaurant you need to modify the HTML in your `home.handlebars` file as follows. 

```html
<h1>Restaurants</h1>
<section>
    {{#each restaurants}}
        <article>
            <header style="background-image: url({{this.image}})"></header>
            <main>{{this.name}}</main>
            <footer>{{this.menus.length}} menus</footer>
        </article>
    {{/each}}
</section>
```
To display the image correctly, you also need to modify the `styles.css` file and target the `<header>` element inside the `<article>` to set some background properties including the image height.
```css
article header {
    height: 24rem;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center center;
}
```
By default, a `background-image` is placed at the top-left corner of an element and repeated both vertically and horizontally. The background of an element is the total size of the element including padding and border (but not the margin).

The CSS `background-repeat` property of `no-repeat` tells the browser to centre the image vertically and horizontally.

The CSS `background-size` property of `cover` tells 
the browser to cover the whole element's background with the image. The aspect ratio will maintained hence part of the image may be clipped.

The CSS `background-position` property of `center center` tells the browser to avoid repeating the image.
