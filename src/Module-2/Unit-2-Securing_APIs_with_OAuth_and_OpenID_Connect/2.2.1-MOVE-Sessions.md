# What is middleware?

## Learning Objectives
* Describe the middleware design pattern
* Use what you have learnt in previous lessons to secure an API using Basic Auth

### Lesson
Your API should support a `User' resource. A user will need at least a name, email and password:

|HTTP Method|URL|Status code|Description|
|-----------|---|-----------|-----------|
|GET|`/users`|200|retrieve all users|
|POST|`/users`|201|create a new user|
|GET|`/users/{id}`|200|retrieve a specific user|
|PUT|`/users/{id}`|200|update a user|
|DELETE|`/users/{id}`|200|delete a user|

Our User resource in an unsecured state is just like any other resource like airports, training shoes or albums. However we are going to treat it differently.

To protect resources we need to authenticate the user making the request. We are using basic auth to do that by putting the _username:password_ in the headers of the request.

Our server now needs to check the request is authentic and from a user it knows before responding. That check needs to happen before we respond.

![middleware diagram](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*Fnreje0WgqdBjjLXop9L0A.png)

As that check happens in the middle of the request response cycle, it has been given the name of middleware. This is a generic design pattern you will see in many systems.

A whole series of things can happen in middleware not just authentication, but also authorisation. Thats why the diagram above has 2 middleware rings. There are 2 middlewares the request has to pass through before it gets to the controller. Below is a general pattern for a middleware function.

```javascript
function (request, response, next) {
  // check or change something in the request
  // maybe its not ok so from here you might
  return response.code(403) // status code 403 forbidden
  // the controller was never reached!
  // maybe all is well and you can contiune with the request
  // calling next() finishes this middleware and goes onto
  // either the next middleware or into the controller/route handler itself
  return next()
}
```

❓ What other things might you want to do in middleware?

❓ is the password sent on every request or cached?

We are going to implement middlewares on our server. First of you need to authenticate the request and only accept requests from users your server knows about (the users in your database). We don't want any user to be able to see a list of all the other users, that is our authorisation rule.

### Assignment
  * Create an API which allows Create, Read, Update and Delete of a User using either SpringBoot or Node.js
  * Enhance your API to protect your User resources with Basic Authentication (see code examples below) and check the incoming username and password against the details held in the database you created in the previous lesson
  * (Optional) Create a simple form which sends a username and password to your API using Basic Auth (i.e. simulates what Postman was doing in the previous lesson).

|Javascript|Java|
```javascript
// check for a basic auth header with correct credentials
app.use(basicAuth({
  authorizer: dbAuthorizer, // customer authorizer,
  authorizeAsync: true, // we check the db which makes this async
  challenge: true,
  unauthorizedResponse: (req) => {
    return `unauthorized. ip: ${req.ip}`
  }
}));

// our custom async authorizer middleware, this is called for each request
function dbAuthorizer(username, password, callback) {
  const sql = "select password from users where username = ?;";
  db.get(sql, [username], async (err, user) => {
    err ? callback(err) : bcrypt.compare(password, user.password, callback);
  });
```
```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private DataSource dataSource;

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {
        // do not use the line below in production apps!!
        httpSecurity.csrf().disable(); // hack to support DELETE method
        httpSecurity.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and().httpBasic();
    }

    @Autowired
    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder authentication)
            throws Exception {
        // use jdbc authentication (for in memory authentication use authentication.inMemoryAuthentication())
        authentication.jdbcAuthentication()
                .dataSource(dataSource)
                .authoritiesByUsernameQuery("select username,authority "
                        + "from authorities "
                        + "where username = ?")
                .usersByUsernameQuery(
                        "select username, password, 'true' as enabled from users where username = ?");

    }

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        // specify we want the password hashed using bcrypt
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
```

# Session based Auth 

## Learning Objectives
* Understand the limitations of Basic Auth
* Know why and how to use sessions on a server 

## Pre-requisites
  * Ensure you have the Postman application installed

## Materials needed
  * Postman application 
  * VS Code (for Javascript development) or IntelliJ (for Java development)

## What's wrong with Basic Auth?
  * The password is sent over the wire in base64 encoding which can be easily decoded (if Basic Auth is used, it should always go over HTTPS for this reason)
  * The password is sent repeatedly i.e. on each request meaning there is a large attack window
  * The password is cached by the web browser, therefore it could be silently reused by any other request to the server e.g. CSRF
  * The password may be stored permanently in the browser hence could be stolen by another user on a shared machine


## Sessions

Wouldn't it be much better if after being authenticated the server could keep track of which users it had already checked the passwords for. This is the purpose of sessions on a server. They are a means by which the server can keep track of who is who. Without sessions our server will just treat each request the same.

Lets have a look at trying to manage state on a server. Start a new project just for this Counter example. Lets be really simple and just imagine we have a counter.

```javascript
class Counter {
    constructor() {
        this.value = 1
    }

    inc() {
        this.value += 1
        return this.value.toString()
    }
}
```

We want to expose this to our users so they can make requests and receive incrementing values i.e. 1,2,3,4,5 etc

```javascript
app.get('/counter', (req, res) => {
    const counter = new Counter()
    res.send(counter.inc())
})
```

❓ What is the problem with this?

Lets pull the counter out of the route and have it in the scope of the server instance:

```javascript
const counter = new Counter()

app.get('/counter', (req, res) => {
    res.send(counter.inc())
})
```

❓ What is the problem with this? (try different browser windows)

The behaviour we are after is each connected client gets their own dedicated counter. So as they refresh their individual page, their personal counter increments.

For this we will need to extend our server by adding sessions. The session object will be added to the request object. Each individually connected client will be allocated a `req.session.id` unique to them and there interaction with the server. On the session object we can store values for that connection. For example:

```javascript
req.session.user_id = user.id
```

You can only store JSON stringable values so our instance of our counter cannot be stored as it will get turned into the string representation of the class instance. No good to us. So we will use the `req.session.id` as a hashkey so we can lookup the counter for each particular connected client.

### Use Sessions

To add sessions `npm i express-session` then use the following config:

```javascript
const session = require('express-session')
const sessionSettings = {
    secret: "best cohort ever",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: true
}
app.use(session(sessionSettings))
```

Update your Counter class to keep track of every instance (use a static property).

```javascript
class Counter {
    static lookup = {}
    
    constructor(id) {
        this.value = 1
        Counter.lookup[id] = this // every counter we create is added to the lookup hash map which we can access at Counter.lookup
    }

    inc() {
        this.value += 1
        return this.value.toString()
    }
}
```

Add a middleware function that will run on every request this makes sure new requests have an instance of the counter they can access with their session id:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    Counter.lookup[req.session.id] = Counter.lookup[req.session.id] || new Counter(req.session.id)
    next()
})
```

finally in the route return the next value

```javascript
app.get('/counter', (req, res) => {
    res.send(Counter.lookup[req.session.id].inc())
})
```

❓ How can we use this functionality to authenticate a user only once?

This is now a more familiar concept to you. Getting a session assigned to you is like 'logging' in. To 'log out' you just remove that counter from the session.

## Assignment

* Implement sessions on your server
* Add `/login` and `/logout` routes
* The `/login` route should be the only route that accepts a Basic Auth request
* Once a user is authenticated with Basic Auth add them to a session
* Update `/users/:id` to only return the user info if the user is in a session
* If a user is in a session and visits the `/logout` route this should end their session,  and they will no longer be able to access `/users/:id`
* Put your solution on Github and share it with your coach
