# Create Read Update Destroy (CRUD)

## Learning Objectives
Use the patterns we have learnt so far to enable users to perform create, read, update and destroy operations.

## Pre-requisites
  * Familiarity with Node.js Express routes
  * Familiarity with the Handlebars framework

## Lesson
In previous lessons we looked at how to retrieve restaurant data and display it in a web page via a Handlebars template and an Express route. We now need to consider how to create, update and delete restaurants.

### Adding a restaurant
Adding a new restaurant will require a new web page with an HTML Form to capture the restaurant name and image. Let's call the template for this page, `new.handlebars`. 

```html
<h2>Add Restaurant</h2>

<form action="/restaurants" method="POST">
    <label>Name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" name="name"><br>

    <label>Image:</label><br>
    <input type="url" name="image"><br><br>

    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
We need to add a new route so that the page will be rendered when the user navigates to `http://localhost:8080/new`.

```javascript
app.get('/new', async (req, res) => {
    res.render('new')
})
```

On submit of the Form, the web page needs to call another route to create the restaurant in the database. When submitting form data, the data is URL encoded hence we need to add a body-parser to Express to enable this data to be read as key-value pairs.

TODO - json?

```javascript
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))

app.post('/restaurants', async (req, res) => {    
    const restaurant = await Restaurant.create(req.body)
    res.redirect('/');
})
```

### Deleting a restaurant
Implementing functionality to delete a restaurant is relatively straightforward. We firstly need to update our `restaurants.handlebars` view template to add a delete button next to each restaurant. For example:

TODO - 

![example of a webpage with a button to delete a restaurant](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/95022824-5dd14900-0671-11eb-9cb3-2d9caa3cbb30.jpg)

We then require a new route on the server which will be called by the delete button to delete the specific restaurant from the database.

```javascript
app.get('/restaurants/:id/delete', async (req, res) => {
    await Restaurant.findByPk(req.params.id)
        .then(restaurant => {
            restaurant.destroy()
            res.redirect('/')
        })
})
```

### Editing a restaurant
What if we make a typo and want to update our restaurant? This is more involved. We need to provide the user with the Form they used to create the restaurant, populated with the current values. We then need a new route to post the new values to.

Let's create a new route that will serve an edit template to the user:

```javascript
app.get('/restaurants/:id/edit', async (req, res) => {
    const restaurant = await Restaurant.findByPk(req.params.id)
    res.render('edit', {restaurant})
})
```
Our edit restaurant Form will look similar to the create restaurant Form except that we will post to a different route. The initial values of the Form fields will be set to the current name / image retrieved from the database.

```html
<form action="/restaurants/{{restaurant.id}}/edit" method="POST">
    <div>
        <label>Restaurant name</label>
        <input name="name" value="{{restaurant.name}}" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <label>Restaurant image</label>
        <input name="image" value="{{restaurant.image}}"/>
    </div>
    <button>Update Restaurant</button>
</form>
```

We can then add a new route to handle the update:

```javascript
app.post('/restaurants/:id/edit', async (req, res) => {
    const restaurant = await Restaurant.findByPk(req.params.id)
    await restaurant.update(req.body)
    res.redirect(`/restaurants/${restaurant.id}`)
})
```

Lastly, we add an edit link to the restaurant page (next to or near the delete button).

## Assignment
1. Add view templates and routes to enable the creation, deletion and editing of a restaurant. Ensure you include client-side validation on each Form.
1. Add in server-side validation to all routes.
1. Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review.

### Assignment extension tasks
Give the user the ability to perform CRUD operations on all three resources, restaurants, menus and items.
