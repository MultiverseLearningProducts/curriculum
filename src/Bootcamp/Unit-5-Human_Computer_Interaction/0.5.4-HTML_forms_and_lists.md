Its time to start having a conversation with our application. At the moment we have implemented data flowing in one direction; from the datastore to the browser. The program tells us what it knows. Now we need to create that journey in the opposite direction; from the user to the datastore. To do that we need a way to interact with our program.

We are going to do this in 3 steps:

1. First of all we need to collect _all_ the data we need to create a new restaurant from our user.
1. Secondly we are going to sent that data to our server
1. Finally if we create the resource ok we need to indicate to the user that our operation has worked and they have been successful; if it didn't work we need to communicate that to our user and advise about what they can do next.

To create a new restaurant we need a name, an image URL, menus those menus need items with prices. It's quite complicated and we'll need to think about collecting quite a lot of data before we are ready to start creating a new resource.

## User input

HTML provides a comprehensive set of elements we can use for data collection.

|Input Type|Data Type|Example|
|:--|:--|:---:|
|text|String|<input type="text"/>|
|number|Number|<input type="number"/>|
|Select (Dropdown)|Emun|<select><option>North</option><option>South</option><option>East</option><option>West</option></select>|
|radio|1 from a list|<input name="radio" type="radio" value="N"><label>North</label></input><input name="radio" type="radio" value="S"><label>South</label></input><input name="radio" type="radio" value="E"><label>East</label></input><input name="radio" type="radio" value="W"><label>West</label></input>|
|checkbox|Many from a list|<input name="radio" type="checkbox" value="N"><label>North</label></input><input name="radio" type="checkbox" value="S"><label>South</label></input><input name="radio" type="checkbox" value="E"><label>East</label></input><input name="radio" type="checkbox" value="W"><label>West</label></input>|
|time|DateTime|<input type="time"/>|
|email|Valid Email|<input type="email"/>|
|tel|Valid Telephone Number|<input type="tel"/>|
|url|Valid URL|<input type="url"/>|
|search|String|<input type="search"/>|
|password|String (masked)|<input type="password"/>|
|range|Number|<input type="range"/>|
|color|HEX code|<input type="color"/>|
|file|file path|<input type="file"/>|

Input elements are enclosed within a `<form>` element. The form element captures the data from all the different input fields it contains and will enable us to intercept and process our inputs before sending them to the server. From the list above can you identify input elements that you might need?

### Create the parent form element

```html
<form id="create-restaurant" onsubmit="processForm(this);return false;">
    <div>
        <label for="restaurant-name">Name of restaurant</label>
        <input id="restaurant-name" name="name" required/>
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="restaurant-image">Upload a hero image</label>
        <input id="restaurant-image" name="image" type="file" accept="image/*" required/>
    </div>
    <div>
        <button>Create</button>
    </div>
</form>
```
The javascript in the `onsubmit` handler is calling a function that is defined below. By returning `false`, we prevent the submit triggered by a `<button>` element within a `<form>` element from reloading the page. This is a useful override as we may not wish to reload the page and lose information the user has given us. We can interact with our API server in the background without disturbing the user experience.

The `<label>` element is a semantic tag and is therefore useful for screen readers and similar technologies. In order to indicate programatically that a label belongs to a particular input, we can either nest the `<input>` within the `<label>`, or match the `<label>` `for` attribute to the `id` of the `<input>` (as above).

The `this` passed to `processForm` is the form element itself. Once we have extracted the data from the form element with `new FormData(form)` we can send that data off to our endpoint.
```javascript
function processForm(form) {
    fetch('http://localhost:3000/restaurants', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: new FormData(form)
    })
    .then(console.info)
    .catch(console.error)
}
```
### Update the server
We are dealing with 'Multipart' form data. The form for the restaurant has multiple parts, the text field with the name of the restaurant, the image file meta data, and the binary content of the image file itself. This is best processed on the server using a middleware called `multer`. You will need to update your server code to handle the images that it receives and configure where and how the files are stored on disc. The URL to that points to the image file needs to be added to the new restaurant record before its stored in your database. Below is an example of how to set up the `multer` middleware to make processing your image uploads easier.
```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const path = require('path')
const multer = require('multer')
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: (req, fileData, next) => {
        // this is where your uploaded image file will be saved
        next(null, path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'uploads'))
    },
    filename: (req, fileData, next) => {
        // name the file however you like I'm using a timestamp
        next(null, new Date().getTime() + path.extname(fileData.originalname))
    }
})
const images = multer({ storage })

app.post('/restaurants', images.single('image'), (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body) // here you can access the text field name of the restaurant req.body.name 
    console.log(req.file) // this object is the meta data you need to store/process
    // the uploaded file will be in your `public/uploads` folder (go look!)
    res.sendStatus(201) // 201 is the response code for successfully creating a resource
})
```
Now you will have a URL for an image that you can display in your UI with your restaurant in `req.file.path` and you can access the name of the restaurant in `req.body.name`.

## Interactivity

You can preview the image you select for your restaurant ([codepen example](https://codepen.io/mobifreaks/pen/LIbca)). This kind of feedback really changes the user's experience of your interface. Think about your create restaurant form as a component with states, for example; when no data has been added, when the name of the restaurant is added, when the image has been selected. It's really professional to provide feedback to the user about the data they have successfully managed to add to the form, and if that data is correct or not.

Your designs will include interactive forms with dynamic lists. An example of an interactive form is one where we need to collect quite complex data from a user. Our restaurant has a name, an image, but also an indeterminate number of menus, and those menus can have any number of items. Considering "Used" from the HCI lesson our interface also needs to deal with mistakes, so if our user makes a spelling mistake or adds the wrong price for a menu item, they need to be able to fix it.

We are not introducing javascript frameworks at the moment we will look at these in more detail in Module 1. You can create all the functionality you need using the `document` API methods we have covered like `createElement` and so on. However you'll find yourself writing a lot of javascript and to help with that lets have a look at a design pattern that lots of frontend frameworks use.

### Separate UI from data

The first mistake to avoid is merging your data with the UI layer. It is easy to start treating the interface layer as the source of your data, but this gets very messy. Think about having a mini data model (often called 'state' in frameworks) that is a javascript object. Create functions that render and re-render that data model.

### Component update cycle

You will end up writing a small frontend application that will be a kind of list builder. Your components will need to provide an interface so users can perform all the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in the form i.e. create a menu item, read the menu item that was added, update the menu item, delete the menu item. The component will have an update cycle.

![a diagram of a components update cycle that shows, render data model, input from user, update data model, render data model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/117293904-e8796100-ae69-11eb-839a-cb4e31b6b5f9.jpg)

When your page loads you can render the data model (which might be empty). Then as you collect input from the user, update your data model, then re-render the data model. Expect to render your component multiple times during an interaction. Follow this pattern, separate out the UI layer from your data and implement an update cycle, this will make it easier to organise and reason about your code.

## Assignment

Implement the remained of your design so users can create new restaurants, and add menus and menu items. Do the work of sending your data to the server and have it persist in your database. Update the UI with the new restaurant/menu/items that you create.

## Top tip

When you create a new resource like a restaurant via an API POST request, if you get your endpoint to return to your frontend code that newly created restaurant (with it's id from being created in the database), you can insert it in the data model in the frontend code and trigger a re-render. This way your newly created restaurant will appear in the UI without the user having to refresh the page. Very slick.
