# Programmatic HTTP requests

## Overview
In this session we are going to make sure everyone is comfortable using fetch in the browser to form more advanced HTTP requests. As well as using a tool like postman, we also want you to know how to send HTTP requests in your client-side javascript code. 

## Learning Objectives
* Set headers in a HTTP request using fetch
* Set GET and POST methods for a fetch HTTP request

## Pre-requisites
* Create a new `index.html` file with a script tag, write your code in the script tag.

## Lesson
Postman is a great tool, very useful for working with new APIs. In this session we are going to learn to do the things we did with postman using the Promise based fetch API in the browser.
```javascript
fetch(`https://api.thesneakerdatabase.com/v1/sneakers?limit=10`)
```
This is the most basic usage, thats a GET request (by default) to the address passed as an argument. We don't deal with the response. The response is async and is a raw response object.
```javascript
fetch(`https://api.thesneakerdatabase.com/v1/sneakers?limit=10`)
    .then(res => console.table(res))
```
![an example of the response object with the status code and headers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/102642314-635d0c00-4155-11eb-9bb6-b91c187d40cd.png)

❓ Can you see the status code?

❓ Are there any headers?

To parse the response into a more friendly JSON object we can call `res.json()` then we can access our data in a convenient format.
```javascript
fetch(`https://api.thesneakerdatabase.com/v1/sneakers?limit=10`)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(res => console.log(res))
```

### Headers
We are going to be working with the headers of our requests so lets have a look at setting headers in the fetch API. Below we are going to POST some data to our endpoint like we did earlier with postman.

```javascript
const url = "https://http-challenge.multiverse-coaches.io/apprentices"
const payload = {
    name: "Frank Zappa"
}
fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})
.then(res => res.text())
.then(msg => {
    const [yourId] = msg.match(/(?<=\/)[a-zA-Z0-9]+(?=')/)
    console.log(yourId, msg)
})
.catch(console.error)
```

## Assignment

Can you repeat the calls that we made earlier to https://http-challenge.multiverse-coaches.io only this time have a script in an `index.html` page that opens in your browser, and makes use of `fetch` to make each call in sequence. You will need to retrieve the 'Your-Id' from the initial GET request and use it in the subsequence requests. You don't need to do the final applied quiz, instead submit your code to github and share a link to your repo with your coach.

# 🤷🏽‍♂️ Tips

* To read the responses you need to call `res.text()`
* You'll need to pluck 'Your-Id' out of the response (see below)
* You will have to manage a series of async requests. Remember fetch is promise based an you can chain `.then` together with one `.catch`. Any errors will be caught by your final catch function.

```javascript
const [yourId] = msg.match(/(?<=\/)[a-zA-Z0-9]+(?=')/)
```

### Assignment extension tasks
* If you work in a different language than JavaScript, try using an HTTP client library to execute the calls. For example, in Java 9 and above you could use the [HTTPClient class](https://www.baeldung.com/java-9-http-client)
* There are many [free APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) available. Find one that is of interest to you and test out calling their APIs.
