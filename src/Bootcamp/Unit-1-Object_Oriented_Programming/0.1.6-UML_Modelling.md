## Learning Objectives

- Students will know that UML diagrams are an industry standard for visually representing the blueprints of a software system
- Students will understand the purpose and syntax of 3 specific UML diagram types, Use Case, Class and Sequence diagrams
- Students will be able to create Use Case, Class and Sequence UML diagrams to model the design of an Electric Scooter Hire system

## Pre-requisites

You have been asked to design an Electric Scooter Hire app system. The requirements for the system are as follows:

- To hire a scooter, a user must download the Electric Scooter Hire app and register their details
- Only users 18 years and above can ride a scooter
- Scooters are rented from charging stations
- There are multiple charging stations in the city
- Only fully charged scooters can be rented
- The location of available scooters must be visible on a map on the app
- A scooter can be unlocked by scanning a QR code
- A scooter must be returned to a charging station
- It takes 2 hours to fully charge a scooter from empty
- Payment is taken once the user has returned their scooter
- A scooter can be marked by a user as broken. This must remove the scooter from a list of available scooters and trigger maintenance personnel to repair the scooter
- The maximum range of a fully charged scooter is 32 km

To complete the assignment you must create the following:

1. A UML Use Case diagram showing the interactions between the user Actor, scooter Actor and the Electric Scooter Hire app system
1. A UML Use Case diagram showing the interactions between the maintenance personnel Actor and scooters
1. A UML Class diagram showing the system's classes, their attributes, methods and inter-relationships
1. A UML Sequence diagram showing the interactions between the user Actor, the Scooter Actor and the classes in the system
1. A UML Sequence diagram showing the interactions between the maintenance personnel Actor and classes in the system

Screenshots of your UML diagrams must be committed to your Github repository.

### Assignment extension tasks

Use the [PlantUML documentation](https://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram) `alt/else` syntax to extend your UML Sequence diagrams to include the handling of error conditions such as the scooter breaking when the user has started the hire period.
