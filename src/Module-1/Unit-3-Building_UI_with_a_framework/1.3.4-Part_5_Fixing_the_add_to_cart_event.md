# Introduction

Now that we've added another component, our `add-to-cart` event will no longer emit back to the app component as the Home component is now rendering the products. To fix this, we'll need to emit the event twice so it gets back to the main app component. If you're thinking that emitting event twice could get tricky to manage, you're spot on. Later, when we integrate Vuex, we won't need to emit any events at all, however, emitting events and passing props in this way is a common framework pattern and one that you would use for smaller apps, so it's great to know.

Here's what our new set-up will look like:
