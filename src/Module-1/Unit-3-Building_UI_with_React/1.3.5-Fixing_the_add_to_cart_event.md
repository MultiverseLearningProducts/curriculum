# Fixing the add to cart event

Now that we've moved the __Home__ component from the top level of the component tree, our `addToCart` setter and state will no longer be in the scope of the top App component as the Home component is now rendering the products further down the tree.

This is now an issue because we will want to display the number of items in the cart in the header section at the top level of the app, at present it is trapped inside the __Home__ component and when we navigate to __About__ or __Contact__ we lose the ability to access and reference the number of items in the cart.

We want the cart state to be global for our app so it needs to be in the highest level component (the __App__ component). We need to move the cart state up from the __Home__ component and pass the props down to __Home__ and __Product__. This is a common framework pattern in React to share state between many components.

## Learning Objectives

- Conceptualise the tree like structure you are building
- Demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between components in the tree by successfully refactoring code

## Fixing the Add to cart event

Let move the __[cart, setCart]__ and __addToCart__ variables and functions out of __Home__ and into __App__. Now pass down the __addToCart__ function from __App__ to __Home__ to __Product__. When you are passing __addToCart__ down to the __Product__ component you will now have to reference it using __props.addToCart__ like this:

```javascript
<Product key={product.productId} product={product} addToCart={props.addToCart} />
```

## Move the header to the __App__ component

Now in the __App__ component we have some navigation already, let us build that out to include the brand header for the site, and the cart. You can add some css to make this look right. My Header now looks some thing like this:

![header example with cart and navigation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4499581/130210876-6b454549-1b5e-45b8-998e-53aa315469e4.png)

```javascript
<header>
    <h1>Plants Direct</h1>
    <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
    </nav>
    <section>ðŸ›’ ({cart.length})</section>
</header>
```

Our refactor now means we have the cart state being rendered in the header and it remains as we navigate from page to page.

## Assignment

- Move the data from the __Home__ component to the __App__ component and update __Home__ to reference `props.data.products`.
- review the code we've written and ensure you understand how the events flow between components. Follow the props from the parent to child component and then back up to the app component here to help your understanding.
