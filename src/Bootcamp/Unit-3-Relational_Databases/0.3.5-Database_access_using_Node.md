# Database access using Node.js

## Learning Objectives
* Connect to a SQL database using Node.js 
* Insert and manipulate data held in an SQL database using Node.js
* Understand how Prepared Statements help to mitigate SQL Injection attacks

## Pre-requisites
* Familiarity with [Basic SQL Commands](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-Relational_Databases/0.3.3-Basic_SQL_Commands.html) and [SQL JOIN](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-Relational_Databases/0.3.4-SQL_Joins.html)

* Installation of the `sqlite` by `alexcvzz` plugin for VSCode. This will allow you to visualise your database. Once installed,
  1. Select `View-Command Palette` from the menu
  2. Type `SQLite: Open Database` to select your database
  3. A `SQLITE EXPLORER` window should appear at the bottom of your VSCode Explorer view displaying your tables. 

* Installation of the SQLite node module. SQLite is a lightweight SQL database commonly used in embedded devices such as phones and games consoles. If you do not already have this installed please follow the instructions below:

  1. Create a [new Node.js project](/curriculum/Bootcamp/FAQ#createNewProject) for this lesson.
  1. Execute `npm install sqlite3` in the directory where your `package.json` lives. If you get errors, try `npm install sqlite3@5.0.0` instead. 

    To check your install is successful, paste the following code into a file named `dbconnect.js` and run the file with `node dbconnect.js`. 

```js
    const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();

    const db = new sqlite3.Database(':memory:', (err) => {
        if (err) {
        return console.error(err.message);
        }
        console.log('Connected to the in-memory SQlite database.');
    });
  
    // close the database connection
    db.close((err) => {
        if (err) {
        return console.error(err.message);
        }
        console.log('Close the database connection.');
    });
```

## Lesson
In this lesson we will save the database as a file written to our local disk rather than in-memory. This means that the data can be accessed even when our program has stopped running. We will interact with our database using JavaScript (Node.js).

The following Node.js code creates a RESTAURANT table in a database named 'restaurants.sqlite':
```js
const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();

function initialise() {
    const db = new sqlite3.Database('./restaurants.sqlite');

    try {
        db.serialize(function () { 
            db.run("CREATE TABLE RESTAURANTS (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT, imagelink TEXT)");
        });
    } finally { 
        // very important to always close database connections
        // else could lead to memory leaks
        db.close();
    }
}
```

This code inserts a row into the RESTAURANT table:

```js
const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();

const db = new sqlite3.Database('./restaurants.sqlite');

try {
    db.serialize(function () { 

    let stmt;

        try {
            stmt = db.prepare(`INSERT INTO RESTAURANTS (name, imagelink) VALUES (?, ?)`);
            stmt.run('Bayroot', 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/Destinations/Europe/England/Brighton/brighton-restaurants-hotel-du-vin-bistro.jpg');
        } finally {
            // release resources 
            stmt.finalize();
        }

        // select the rows and print them out
        db.each("SELECT * FROM Restaurants",
            function (err, rows) {  
                console.log(rows);  
            }
        );
    });
} finally {
    // release resources 
    db.close();  
}

```     
Let's walk through the code step by step.

```javascript
const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose;
const db = new sqlite3.Database('./db.sqlite');
```
In the lines above we import the `sqlite3` package (and set the execution mode to "verbose" to produce detailed stack traces) then instantiate a new instance of our database for our program. We can pass some config to our `Database` constructor, here we are passing in a relative path to where the database file either already exists, or where we would like it to be created and with what name.

The code uses a [try/finally](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_try_catch.asp) block to ensure that the statement and database are closed regardless of whether an error occurs. This is best practice to avoid memory leaks.

The insert code also makes use of [Prepared Statements](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) which are key for ensure your database applications are not vulnerable to [SQL injection attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection).

## Assignment
1. Create a js file (named `initialiseDB.js`) which contains code to create all the tables described by the UML diagram in the [SQL Joins](/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-3-Relational_Databases/0.3.4-SQL_Joins.html) lesson. Ensure you create FOREIGN KEYs as appropriate. 

1. Create a js file (named `populateDB.js`) which contains code to insert one row into the Restaurant table and ensure that this Restaurant has 2 Menus. Insert 2 Menu Items per Menu. 

1. Write Node.js code to list all the Menu Items belonging to a specific Menu for a specific Restaurant.

1. Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review.
