# Module 2
## Secure Rest API servers

In this Module we are going to study all the different parts of an HTTP request. This is foundational knowledge that the rest of the module is built on. We will study some aspects of cryptography that are used in authentication. Once we have knowledge of HTTP and the use of cryptography in software, we can put it all together.

We will study 'Basic' auth and the more complex token based OAuth. Finally we will leverage a 3rd party service (Auth0) to help with our user authentication.
