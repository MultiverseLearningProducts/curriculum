## Lesson

### Understand what CSS is and what it does

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the language we use to style a web page. Whereas HTML provides the means to structure a web page, CSS controls the presentation of the page.

In older versions of HTML, you could actually write styles directly into the HTML tags. This made life very tricky for developers, as they didn't have one source of truth when it came to styles. It also meant they had duplicate style definitions. CSS solves this problem by providing the ability to style many elements across different pages, using just one set of styles.

> Good to know: the "Cascading" part of CSS refers to the algorithm the browser uses to decide which styles to apply to an element

### Understand inline vs external CSS

CSS can be embedded into our websites in two ways: inline and/or via an external stylesheet file.

Adding inline CSS is simple. In the `<head>` section of your HTML, add:

```css
<style>
  /* add styles here */
</style>
```

To use an external file, you need to fashion a `.css` file in your directory. You then link to the file in the `<head>` section as follows:

```css
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/myStyles.css">
```

> The _rel_ stands for relationship and tells the browser what the resource is

Large websites with hundreds if not thousands of lines of CSS will _always_ use external files. This is because these files can be minified and then cached by the browser. If you're just testing or have a very small amount of CSS, then it's perfectly acceptable to use the inline technique.

> You can also add styles directly to an element using the style attribute: `<p style="color: blue">Blue text</p>`

### Understand the basic syntax

Below is a simple stylesheet that styles every occurrence of a heading and a paragraph. You can think of these as global styles. Since there is only ever one body tag, the body styles will apply to this tag only. The syntax starts with an element declaration (e.g body) and then the style properties for that element, enclosed in curly braces.

```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana, sans-serif;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

### Understand the difference between classes and IDs

So far we've styled elements using their global selectors, but we can also style by `class` and by `id`.

```css
p {
  font-family: verdana, sans-serif;
  font-size: 20px;
  color: black;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

p.bigger-paragraph {
  font-size: 30px;
}

p#specific-paragraph {
  color: red;
}
```

You can see the result: [here](https://jsfiddle.net/qy6wzo0r/1/).

Notice that the global paragraph styles apply to both customised paragraph selectors - this is CSS inheritance in action, where descendents inherit the parent's styles.

Also notice that the paragraph with an ID overrides the global paragraph. This is to do with _specificity_. In this example, the ID is a more specific selector and therefore takes precedence over the global selector.

So when do you use classes and when do you use IDs?

- Classes should be used when you want styles to apply to one or more elements on a page

- An ID on the other hand, is unique, and should only feature once on a page

Selectors don't need to be prefixed by the type of element, but this can be useful if you know that you only want the styles to apply to elements of a certain type. In contrast, the following class and ID would work just fine and could be applied to any element:

```css
.bigger {
  font-size: 30px;
}

#specific {
  color: red;
}
```

### Understand the units of measure

You will mostly come across the following units of measure when working with stylesheets: `pixels`, `ems`, and `rems`.

- Pixels are an absolute measurement (i.e fixed) and represent a dot on your display (more dots if you're using a HD screen)

- ems are a relative unit of measure where 2em is equivalent to two times the font size of the element where it's used, or the parent element if the value is inherited

- rems are also relative, but this time, relative to the root element (normally the HTML element). 2rem is two times the root element's font size.

```html
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child">I'm the child of parent div</div>
</div>
```

```css
html {
  font-size: 16px;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 1.6rem; /* 1.6 * 16 = 26.6px */

  /* 
    you can also get the rem value by dividing the pixel size
    into the base pixel value: 26.6 / 16 = 1.6rem (rounded)
  */
}

.parent {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.child {
  font-size: 1.5em;
  /* 
    1.5 * 18 = 27px 
    27 / 18 = 1.5em
  */
}
```

So, which unit should you use?

There is plenty of debate about this on the web and many people's views differ. The advantage of using a relative measurement like rems on your webpage is that the whole page will scale well when zoomed in/out because they are all relative to the root element.

If you're just starting out, stick with pixels for everything. If you've got a bit more experience under your belt, experiment with rems. Ems can be used very sparingly for small, self-contained elements.

### Understand borders, margin and padding

Now that we've gained a little more understanding of the measurements, we can start to add borders, margin and padding to some elements.

- Margin adds transparent space to the outside of an element
- Padding adds transparent space around the content of an element
- A border adds a line around element, including any padding

All of the above can be expressed in pixels, rems or ems.

### The box model

The box model is a box that wraps every HTML element and serves as very useful tool to understand how elements are structured. The box model and therefore every HTML element consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

## Assignment

A marketing company would like you to create a simple email template that will contain the latest SWE news.

- The template needs a h1 that reads "Today's top stories"

- The template needs three sections; each one containing a news item with a h2, a paragraph intro and a button linking to the full article. The section can have a preview thumbnail but this is optional

- The layout need not be complex but the company does require the font, margin, padding and any borders to be consistent throughout

- The marketing company is happy for you to build and test the template in the browser

## Assignment extension tasks

- Take a look at semantic elements and see if you can add any to your template
- Checkout flexbox and see if you can integrate some additional layout styles
