### What's wrong with Basic Auth?
  * The password is sent over the wire in Base64 encoding which can be easily decoded (if Basic Auth is used, it should always go over HTTPS for this reason)
  * The password is sent repeatedly i.e. on each request meaning there is a large attack window ??
  * The password is cached by the web browser, therefore it could be silently reused by any other request to the server e.g. CSRF
  * The password may be stored permanently in the browser hence could be stolen by another user on a shared machine
  * No way to revoke
