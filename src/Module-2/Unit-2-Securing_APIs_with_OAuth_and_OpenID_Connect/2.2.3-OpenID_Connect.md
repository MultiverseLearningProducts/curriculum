# OpenID Connect

## Learning Objectives
* Understand the difference between OAuth and OpenID Connect
* Know that Auth0 can store usernames and passwords on your behalf 
* Set up Auth0's universal login


## Lesson
OAuth deals specifically with <em>authorization</em>. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a protocol which is built on top of OAuth 2.0 and focusses on user <em>authentication</em>. It is widely used to enable user logins on websites and mobile apps.

OIDC allows apps to verify the identity of the end user and obtain basic profile information such as name and email address. This profile information is held within another JWT known as the ID token.

> Use https://jwt.io to find out the name and email hidden in this JWT ID token `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkZyZWQgRmxpbnRzdG9uZSIsImVtYWlsIjoiZnJlZC5mbGludHN0b25lQHdoaXRlaGF0Lm9yZy51ayIsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.DlHfHG2qZXpWszZv-X8LwoQkZUlqVgaXoRmnHXE2y_I`

## Implementing authentication using Auth0
In this lesson we will store our usernames and passwords in Auth0. This is not strictly necessary as Auth0 supports connecting to other datasources to vaidate credentials, however, doing so simplifies our implementation. 

### Adding usernames & passwords to Auth0
Navigate to `User Management->Users` and choose to `Create User`. Enter the credentials and click `Create`. Repeat for any other users you have. Note that Auth0 will take care of hashing the passwords for you.

### Creating a login page
Auth0's login page can be integrated into many different types of apps including mobile, single page apps (SPAs) and regular web apps. For this lesson we will choose to add login/logout and profile functionality to an SPA written using React.

1. Using the Auth0 Dashboard, navigate to `Applications` and choose to `Create Application`. Choose `Single Page Web Applications`.
1. Follow the wizard and select `React` as your technology
1. Click on `Download Sample`

   You will be instructed make some configuration changes to the application which will be created. Don't worry about these changes just yet, just click the `Download` button.

   You should now see a new application called `My App` in the Auth0 Dashboard and code for a sample SPA should have been downloaded as a zip file. You can read more about how the sample web app works [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/01-login).

1. Navigate to the Auth0 Dashboard `Applications->APIs` and authorise `My App` to have access to the Messages API. 
1. Add the following configuration to `My App`

   This is required to support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and to enable Auth0 to redirect back to a web page after successful login/logout.

1. Extract the zip and import the code into VSCode
1. The README.md file walks you through the steps to run your application. Note that there is no need to confgure credentials as the `src/auth_config.json` file is already configured with your specific Auth0 details.
1. Add `auth_config.json` to your `.gitignore` to avoid details of your Auth0 account being saved to git.
1. Follow the README instructions to start your application, then navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. The following web page should be displayed.

1. Clicking "Login" will display the [Auth0 Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login) page

1. Enter the username and password you added to Auth0 and you should now be successfully logged in

1. Select "Profile" to view your user profile information. This information is held in a JWT ID token called `req.oidc.user`.

    <img width="658" alt="Profile information" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1316724/130910094-1f29a94c-05e5-4ffb-8247-77445d5fea54.PNG">

Well done, you have successfully authenticated a user using OIDC!

## Assignment
In the previous lesson you used OAuth to secure your Messages API. In this lesson you used OIDC to implement user authentication and add login/logout functionality to a web app. Now we need to connect the two parts!

In this assignment you are required to extend your SPA to call the Messages API only if the user is logged in.

The following code snippets will help you.

How to retrieve an access token
```javascript
    const accessToken = await getAccessTokenSilently({
          audience: 'messagesAPI'
          });
```

How to call your API passing the access token
```javascript
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:YOUR_API_PORT/messages', {
      method: 'GET',
      crossDomain: true,
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
      }
    });

    // Fetch the JSON result
    const responseData = await response.json();
``` 
How to access the user token
```javascript
auth0.getUser();
```
One the integration is complete, commit your code to GitHub and notify your coach that this assignment is complete.
